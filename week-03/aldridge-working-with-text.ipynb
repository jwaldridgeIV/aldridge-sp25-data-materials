       "\"A NARRATIVE OF THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES\\n\\nOF VENTURE, A NATIVE OF AFRICA,\\n\\nBut resident above sixty years in the United States of America.\\n\\nRELATED BY HIMSELF.\\n\\nVENTURE SMITH\\n\\nNew London, 1798\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPREFACE\\n\\nThe following account of  the life of VENTURE, is a relation of simple\\nfacts, in which nothing is in substance to what he relates himself.\\nMany other interesting and curious passages of his life might have\\nbeen inserted, but on account of the bulk to which they must\\nnecessarily have swelled this narrative, they were omitted.  If any\\nshould suspect the truth of what is here related, they are referred to\\npeople now living who are acquainted with most of the facts mentioned\\nin this narrative.\\n\\nThe reader is here presented with an account, not of a renowned\\npolitician or warrior, but of an untutored African slave, brought into\\nthis Christian country at eight years of age, wholly destitute of all\\neducation but what he received in common with other domesticated\\nanimals, enjoying no advantages that could lead him to suppose himself\\nsuperior to the beasts, his fellow servants.  And if he shall enjoy no\\nother advantage from perusing this narrative, he may experience those\\nsensations of shame and indignation, that will prove him to be not\\nwholly destitute of every noble and generous feeling.\\n\\nThe subject of the following pages, had he received only a common\\neducation, might have been a man of high respectability and\\nusefulness; and had his education been suited to his genius, he might\\nhave been an ornament and an honor to human nature.  It may perhaps,\\nnot be unpleasing to see the efforts of a great mind wholly\\nuncultivated, enfeebled and depressed by slavery, and struggling under\\nevery disadvantage.  The reader may here see a Franklin and a\\nWashington, in a state of nature, or rather, in a state of slavery.\\nDestitute as he is of all education, he still exhibits striking traces\\nof native ingenuity and good sense.\\n\\nThis narrative exhibits a pattern of honesty, prudence, and industry,\\nto people of his own colour; and perhaps some white people would not\\nfind themselves degraded by imitating such an example.\\n\\nThe following account is published in compliance with the earnest\\ndesire of the subject of it, and likewise a number of respectable\\npersons who are acquainted with him.\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER I.\\n\\n_Containing an account of his life, from his birth to the time of his\\n                  leaving his native country._\\n\\nI was born at Dukandarra, in Guinea, about the year 1729.  My father's\\nname was Saungm Furro, Prince of the Tribe of Dukandarra.  My father\\nhad three wives.  Polygamy was not uncommon in that country,\\nespecially among the rich, as every man was allowed to keep as many\\nwives as he could maintain.  By his first wife he had three children.\\nThe eldest of them was myself, named by my father Broteer.  The other\\ntwo were named Cundazo and Soozaduka.  My father had two children by\\nhis second wife, and one by his third.  I descended from a very large,\\ntall and stout race of beings, much larger than the generality of\\npeople in other parts of the globe, being commonly considerably above\\nsix feet in height, and in every way well proportioned.\\n\\nThe first thing worthy of notice which I remember was, a contention\\nbetween my father and mother, on account of my father's marrying his\\nthird wife without the consent of his first and eldest, which was\\ncontrary to the custom generally observed among my countrymen.  In\\nconsequence of this rupture, my mother left her husband and country,\\nand travelled away with her three children to the eastward.  I was\\nthen five years old.  She took not the least sustenance along with\\nher, to support either herself or children.  I was able to travel\\nalong by her side; the other two of her offspring she carried one on\\nher back, and the other being a sucking child, in her arms.  When we\\nbecame hungry, my mother used to set us down on the ground, and gather\\nsome of the fruits which grew spontaneously in that climate.  These\\nserved us for food on the way.  At night we all lay down together in\\nthe most secure place we could find, and reposed ourselves until\\nmorning.  Though there were many noxious animals there; yet so kind\\nwas our Almighty protector, that none of them were ever permitted to\\nhurt or molest us.  Thus we went on our journey until the second day\\nafter our departure from Dukandarra, when we came to the entrance of a\\ngreat desert.  During our travel in that we were often affrighted with\\nthe doleful howlings and yellings of wolves, lions, and other animals.\\nAfter five days travel we came to the end of this desert, and\\nimmediately entered into a beautiful and extensive interval country.\\nHere my mother was pleased to stop and seek a refuge for me.  She left\\nme at the house of a very rich farmer.  I was then, I should judge,\\nnot less than one hundred forty miles from my native place, separated\\nfrom all my relations and acquaintance.  At this place my mother took\\nher farewell of me, and set out for her own country.  My new guardian,\\nas I shall call the man with whom I was left, put me into the business\\nof tending sheep, immediately after I was left with him.  The flock\\nwhich I kept with the assistance of a boy, consisted of about forty.\\nWe drove them every morning between two and three miles to pasture,\\ninto the wide and delightful plains.  When night drew on, we drove\\nthem home and secured them in the cote.  In this round I continued\\nduring my stay there.  One incident that befel me when I was driving\\nmy flock from pasture, was so dreadful to me at that age, and is to\\nthis time fresh in my memory, that I cannot help noticing it in this\\nplace.  Two large dogs sallied out of a certain house and set upon me.\\nOne of them took me by the arm, and the other by the thigh, and before\\ntheir master could come and relieve me, they lacerated my flesh to\\nsuch a degree, that the scars are very visible to the present day.  My\\nmaster was immediately sent for.  He came and carried me home, as I\\nwas unable to go myself on account of my wounds.  Nothing remarkable\\nhappened afterwards until my father sent for me to return home.\\n\\nBefore I dismiss this country, I must just inform my reader what I\\nremember concerning this place.  A large river runs through this\\ncountry in a westerly course.  The land for a great way on each side\\nis flat and level, hedged in by a considerable rise of the country at\\na great distance from it.  It scarce ever rains there, yet the land is\\nfertile; great dews fall in the night which refresh the soil.  About\\nthe latter end of June or first of July, the river begins to rise, and\\ngradually increases until it has inundated the country for a great\\ndistance, to a height of seven or eight feet.  This brings on a slime\\nwhich enriches the land surprisingly.  When the river has subsided,\\nthe natives begin to sow and plant, and the vegetation is exceedingly\\nrapid.  Near this rich river my guardian's land lay.  He possessed, I\\ncannot tell exactly how much, yet this I am certain of respecting it,\\nthat he owned an immense tract.  He possessed likewise a great many\\ncattle and goats.  During my stay with him I was kindly used, and with\\nas much tenderness, for what I saw, as his only son, although I was an\\nentire stranger to him, remote from friends and relations.  The\\nprincipal occupation of the inhabitants there, were the cultivation of\\nthe soil and the care of their flocks.  They were a people pretty\\nsimilar in every respect to that of mine,  except in their persons,\\nwhich were not so tall and stout.  They appeared to be very kind and\\nfriendly.  I will now return to my departure from that place.\\n\\nMy father sent a man and horse after me.  After settling with my\\nguardian for keeping me, he took me away and went for home.  It was\\nthen about one year since my mother brought me here.  Nothing\\nremarkable occured to us on our journey until we arrived safe home.\\n\\nI found then that the difference between my parents had been made up\\nprevious to their sending for me.  On my return, I was received both\\nby my father and mother with great joy and affection, and was once\\nmore restored to my paternal dwelling in peace and happiness.  I was\\nthen about six years old.\\n\\nNot more than six weeks had passed after my return, before a message\\nwas brought by an inhabitant of the place where I lived the preceding\\nyear to my father, that that place had been invaded by a numerous\\narmy, from a nation not far distant, furnished with musical\\ninstruments, and all kinds of arms then in use; that they were\\ninstigated by some white nation who equipped and sent them to subdue\\nand possess the country, that his nation had made no preparation for\\nwar, having been for a long time in profound peace that they could not\\ndefend themselves against such a formidable train of invaders, and\\nmust therefore necessarily evacuate their lands to the fierce enemy,\\nand fly to the protection of some chief; and that if he would permit\\nthem they should come under his rule and protection when they had to\\nretreat from their own possessions.  He was a kind and merciful\\nprince, and therefore consented to these proposals.\\n\\nHe had scarcely returned to his nation with the message, before the\\nwhole of his people were obliged to retreat from their country, and\\ncome to my fathers dominions.\\n\\nHe gave them every privilege and all the protection his government\\ncould afford.  But they had not been there longer than four days\\nbefore news came to them that the invaders had laid waste their\\ncountry, and were coming speedily to destroy them in my father's\\nterritories. This affrighted them, and therefore they immediately\\npushed off to the southward, into the unknown countries there, and\\nwere never more heard of.\\n\\nTwo days after their retreat, the report turned out to be but too\\ntrue.  A detachment of the enemy came to my father and informed him,\\nthat the whole army was encamped not far out of his dominions, and\\nwould invade the territory and deprive his people of their liberties\\nand rights, if he did not comply with the following terms.  These were\\nto pay them a large sum of money, three hundred fat cattle, and a\\ngreat number of goats, sheep, asses, &c.\\n\\nMy father told the messenger that he would comply rather than that his\\nsubjects should be deprived of their rights and privileges, which he\\nwas not then in circumstances to defend from so sudden an invasion.\\nUpon turning out those articles, the enemy pledged their faith and\\nhonor that they would not attack him.  On these he relied and\\ntherefore thought it unnecessary to be on his guard against the enemy.\\nBut their pledges of faith and honor proved no better than those of\\nother unprincipled hostile nations; for a few days after a certain\\nrelation of the king came and informed him, that the enemy who sent\\nterms of accommodation to him, and received tribute to their\\nsatisfaction, yet meditated an attack on his subjects by surprise, and\\nthat probably they would commence their attack in less than one day,\\nand concluded with advising him, as he was not prepared for war, to\\norder a speedy retreat of his family and subjects.  He complied with\\nthis advice.\\n\\nThe same night which was fixed upon to retreat, my father and his\\nfamily set off about break of day.  The king and his two younger wives\\nwent in one company, and my mother and her children in another.  We\\nleft our dwellings in succession, and my father's company went on\\nfirst.  We directed our course for a large shrub plain, some distance\\noff, where we intended to conceal ourselves from the approaching\\nenemy, until we could refresh and rest ourselves a little.  But we\\npresently found that our retreat was not secure.  For having struck up\\na little fire for purposes of cooking victuals, the enemy who happened\\nto be encamped a little distance off, had sent out a scouting party\\nwhich discovered us by the smoke of the fire, just as we were\\nextinguishing it and about to eat.  As soon as we had finished eating,\\nmy father discovered the party, and immediately began to discharge\\narrows at them.  This was what I first saw, and it alarmed both me and\\nthe women, who being unable to make any resistance, immediately betook\\nourselves to the tall thick reeds not far off, and left the old king\\nto fight alone.  For some time, I beheld him from the reeds defending\\nhimself with  great courage and firmness, till at last he was obliged\\nto surrender himself into their hands.\\n\\nThen they came to us in the reeds, and the very first salute I had\\nfrom them was a violent blow on the head with the fore part of a gun,\\nand at the same time a grasp round the neck.  I then had a rope put\\nabout my neck, as had all the women in the thicket with me, and were\\nimmediately led to my father, who was likewise pinioned and haltered\\nfor leading.  In this condition we were all led to the camp.  The\\nwomen and myself being pretty submissive, had tolerable treatment from\\nthe enemy, while my father was closely interrogated respecting his\\nmoney which they knew he must have.  But as he gave them no account of\\nit, he was instantly cut and pounded on his body with great\\ninhumanity, that he might be induced by the torture he suffered to\\nmake the discovery.  All this availed not the least to make him give\\nup his money, but he despised all the tortures which they inflicted,\\nuntil the continued exercise and increase of torment, obliged him to\\nsink and expire.  He thus died without informing his enemies of the\\nplace where his money lay.  I saw him while he was thus tortured to\\ndeath.  The shocking scene is to this day fresh in my mind, and I have\\noften been overcome while thinking on it.  He was a man of remarkable\\nstature.  I should judge as much as six feet and six or seven inches\\nhigh, two feet across his shoulders, and every way well proportioned.\\nHe as a man of remarkable strength and resolution, affable, kind and\\ngentle, ruling with equity and moderation.\\n\\nThe army of the enemy was large, I should suppose consisting of about\\nsix thousand men.  Their leader was called Baukurre.  After destroying\\nthe old prince, they decamped and immediately marched towards the sea,\\nlying to the west, taking with them myself and the women prisoners.\\nIn the march a scouting party was detached from the main army.  To the\\nleader of this party I was made waiter, having to carry his gun, &c.\\nAs we were a scouting we came across a herd of fat cattle, consisting\\nof about thirty in number.  These we set upon, and immediately wrested\\nfrom their keepers, and afterwards converted them into food for the\\narmy.  The enemy had remarkable success in destroying the country\\nwherever they went.  For as far as they had penetrated, they laid the\\nhabitations waste and captured the people.  The distance they had now\\nbrought me was about four hundred miles.  All the march I had very\\nhard tasks imposed on me, which I must perform on pain of punishment.\\nI was obliged to carry on my head a large flat stone used for grinding\\nour corn, weighing as I should suppose, as much as 25 pounds; besides\\nvictuals, mat and cooking utensils.  Though I was pretty large and\\nstout of my age, yet these burthens were very grievous to me, being\\nonly about six years and a half old.\\n\\nWe were then come to a place called Malagafco.  When we entered the\\nplace we could not see the least appearance of either houses or\\ninhabitants, but upon stricter search found, that instead of houses\\nabove ground they had dens in the sides of hillocks, contiguous to\\nponds and streams of water.  In these we perceived they had all hid\\nthemselves, as I suppose they usually did upon such occasions.  In\\norder to compel them to surrender, the enemy contrived to smoke them\\nout with faggots.  These they put to the entrance of the caves and set\\nthem on fire.  While they were engaged in this business, to their\\ngreat surprise some of them were desperately wounded with arrows which\\nfell from above on them.  This mystery they soon found out.  They\\nperceived that the enemy discharged these arrows through holes on the\\ntop of the dens directly in to the air.  Their weight brought them\\nback, point downwards on their enemies heads, whilst they were smoking\\nthe inhabitants out.  The points of the arrows were poisoned, but\\ntheir enemy had an antidote for it, which they instantly applied to\\nthe wounded part.  The smoke at last obliged the people to give\\nthemselves up.  They came out of their caves, first spatting the palms\\nof their hands together, then and immediately after extended their\\narms, crossed at their wrists, ready to be bound and pinioned.  I\\nshould judge that the dens above mentioned were extended about eight\\nfeet horizontally into the earth, five feet in height and as many\\nwide.  They were arched over head and lined with earth, which was of\\nthe clay kind, and made the surface of their walls firm and smooth.\\n\\nThe invaders then pinioned the prisoners of all ages and sexes\\nindiscriminately, took their flocks and all their effects, and moved\\non their way towards the sea.  On the march the prisoners were treated\\nwith clemency, on account of their being submissive and humble.\\nHaving come to the next tribe, the enemy laid siege and immediately\\ntook men, women, children, flocks, and all their valuable effects.\\nThey then went on to the next district which was contiguous with the\\nsea, called in Africa, Anamaboo.  The enemies provisions were then\\nalmost spent, as well as their strength.  The inhabitants knowing what\\nkind of conduct they had pursued, and what were their present\\nintentions, improved the favorable opportunity, attacked them, and\\ntook enemy, prisoners, flocks and all their effects.  I was then taken\\na second time.  All of us were then put into the castle, and kept for\\nmarket.  On a certain time I and other prisoners were put on board a\\ncanoe, under our master, and rowed away to a vessel belonging to Rhode\\nIsland, commanded by capt. Collingwood, and the mate Thomas Mumford.\\nWhile we were going to the vessel, our master told us all to appear to\\nthe best possible advantage for sale.  I was bought on board by one\\nRobertson Mumford, steward of said vessel, for four gallons of rum,\\nand a piece of calico, and called VENTURE, on account of his having\\npurchased me with his own private venture.  Thus I came by my name.\\nAll the slaves that were bought for that vessel's cargo, were two\\nhundred and sixty.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\n  _Containing an account of his life, from the time of his leaving\\n               Africa, to that of his becoming free._\\n\\nAfter all the business was ended on the coast of Africa, the ship\\nsailed from thence to Barbadoes.  After an ordinary passage, except\\ngreat mortality from small pox, which broke out on board, we arrived\\nat the island of Barbadoes: but when we reached it, there were found\\nout of the two hundred and sixty that sailed from Africa, not more\\nthan two hundred alive.  These were all sold, except for myself and\\nthree more, to the planters there.\\n\\nThe vessel then sailed for Rhode Island, and arrived there after a\\ncomfortable passage.  Here my master sent me to live with one of his\\nsisters, until he could carry me to Fisher's Island, the place of his\\nresidence.  I had then competed my eighth year.  After staying with\\nhis sister some time I was taken to my master's place to live.\\n\\nWhen we arrived at Narragansett, my master went ashore in order to\\nreturn a part of the way by land, and gave me the charge of the keys\\nof his trunks on board the vessel, and charged me not to deliver them\\nup to any body, not even to his father without his orders.  To his\\ndirections I promised faithfully to conform.  When I arrived with my\\nmaster's articles at his house, my master's father asked me for his\\nson's keys, as he wanted to see what his trunks contained.  I told him\\nthat my master intrusted me with the care of them until he should\\nreturn, and that I had given him my word to be faithful to the trust,\\nand could not therefore give him or any other person the keys without\\nmy master's directions.  He insisted that I should deliver him the\\nkeys, threatening to punish me if I did not.  But I let him know that\\nhe should not have them say what he would.  He then laid aside trying\\nto get them.  But notwithstanding he appeared to give up trying to\\nobtain them from me, yet I mistrusted that he would take some time\\nwhen I was off my guard, either in the day time or at night to get\\nthem, therefore I slung them around my neck, and in the day concealed\\nthem in my bosom, and at night I always lay with them under me, that\\nno person might take them from me without being apprized of it.  Thus\\nI kept the keys from every body until my master came home.  When he\\nreturned he asked where VENTURE was.  As I was then within hearing, I\\ncame, said, here sir, at your service.  He asked me for his keys, and\\nI immediately took them off my neck and reached them out to him.  He\\ntook them, stroked my hair, and commended me, saying in presence of\\nhis father that his young VENTURE was so faithful that he would never\\nhave been able to have taken the keys from him but by violence; that\\nhe should not fear to trust him with his whole fortune, for that he\\nhad been in his native place so habituated to keeping his word, that\\nhe would sacrifice even his life to maintain it.\\n\\nThe first of the time of living at my master's own place, I was pretty\\nmuch employed in the house at carding wool and other household\\nbusiness.  In this situation I continued for some years, after which\\nmy master put me to work out of doors.  After many proofs of my\\nfaithfulness and honesty, my master began to put great confidence in\\nme.  My behavior to him had as yet been submissive and obedient.  I\\nthen began to have hard tasks imposed on me.  Some of these were to\\npound four bushels of ears of corn every night in a barrel for the\\npoultry, or be rigorously punished.  At other seasons of the year I\\nhad to card wool until a very late hour.  These tasks I had to perform\\nwhen I was about nine years old.  Some time after I had another\\ndifficulty and oppression which was greater than any I had ever\\nexperienced since I came into this country.  This was to serve two\\nmasters.  James Mumford, my master's son, when his father had gone\\nfrom home in the morning, and given me a stint to perform that day,\\nwould order me to do _this_ and _that_ business different from what my\\nmaster directed me.  One day in particular, the authority which my\\nmaster's son had set up, had like to have produce melancholy effects.\\nFor my master having set me off my business to perform that day and\\nthen left me to perform it, his son came up to me in the course of the\\nday, big with authority, and and commanded me very arrogantly to quit\\nmy present business and go directly about what he should order me.  I\\nreplied to him that my master had given me so much to perform that\\nday, and that I must therefore faithfully complete it in that time.\\nHe then broke out in a great rage, snatched a pitchfork and went to\\nlay me over the head therewith; but I as soon got another and defended\\nmyself with it, or otherwise he might have murdered me in his outrage.\\nHe immediately called some people who were hearing at work for him,\\nand ordered them to take his hair rope and and come and bind me with\\nit.  They all tried to bind me but in vain, tho' there were three\\nassistants in number.  My upstart master than desisted, put his pocket\\nhandkerchief before his eyes and went home with a design to tell his\\nmother of the struggle with young VENTURE.  He told her that their\\nyoung VENTURE had become so stubborn that he could not controul him,\\nand asked her what he should do with him.  In the mean time I\\nrecovered my temper, voluntarily caused myself to be bound by the same\\nmen who tried in vain before, and carried before my young master, that\\nhe might do what he pleased with me.  He took me to a gallows made for\\nthe purpose of hanging cattle on, and suspended me on it.  Afterwards\\nhe ordered one of his hands to go to the peach orchard and cut him\\nthree dozens of whips to punish me with.  These were brought to him,\\nand that was all that was done with them, as I was released and went\\nto work after hanging on the gallows about an hour.\\n\\nAfter I lived with my master thirteen years, being then about twenty\\ntwo years old, I married Meg, a slave of his who was about my age.  My\\nmaster owned a certain Irishman, named Heddy, who about that time\\nformed a plan of secretly leaving his master.  After he had long had\\nthis plan in meditation he suggested it to me.  At first I cast a deaf\\near on it, and rebuked Heddy for harboring in his mind such a rash\\nundertaking.  But after he had persuaded and much enchanted me with\\nthe prospect of gaining my freedom with such a method, I at length\\nagreed to accompany him.  Heddy next inveigled two of his fellow\\nservants to accompany us.  The place to which we designed to go was\\nthe Mississippi.  Our next business was to lay in a sufficient store\\nof provisions for our voyage.  We privately collected out of our\\nmaster's store, six great old cheeses, two firkins of butter, and one\\nwhole batch of new bread.  When we had gathered all our own clothes\\nand some more, we took them all about midnight, and went to the water\\nside.  We stole our master's boat, embarked, then directed our course\\nfor the Mississippi river.\\n\\nWe mutually confederated not to betray or desert one another on pain\\nof death.  We first steered our course for Montauk point, the east end\\nof Long-Island.  After our arrival there we landed, and Heddy and I\\nmade an incursion into the island after fresh water, while our two\\ncomrades were left at a little distance from the boat, employed at\\ncooking.  When Heddy and I had sought some time for water, he returned\\nto our companions, and I continued on looking for my object.  When\\nHeddy had performed his business with our companions, who were engaged\\nin cooking, he went directly to the boat, stole all the clothes in it,\\nand then travelled away for East-Hampton, as I was informed.  I\\nreturned to my fellows not long after.  They informed me that our\\nclothes were stolen, but could not determine who was the thief, yet\\nthey suspected Heddy as he was missing.  After reproving my two\\ncomrades for not taking care of our things which were in the boat, I\\nadvertised Heddy and sent two men in search of him.  They pursued and\\novertook him at Southampton and returned him to the boat.  I then\\nthought it might afford some chance for my freedom, or at least a\\npalliation for my running away, to return Heddy immediately to his\\nmaster, and inform him that I was induced to go away by Heddy's\\naddress.  Accordingly I set off with him and the rest of my companions\\nfor our master's, and arrived there without any difficulty.  I\\ninformed my master that Heddy was the ringleader of our revolt, and\\nthat he had used us ill.  He immediately put Heddy into custody, and\\nmyself and companions were well received and went to work as usual.\\n\\nNot a long time passed after that, before Heddy was sent by my master\\nto New-London gaol.  At the close of that year I was sold to a Thomas\\nStanton, and had to be separated from my wife and one daughter, who\\nwas about one month old.  He resided at Stonington-point.  To this\\nplace I brought with me from my last master's, two johannes, three old\\nSpanish dollars, and two thousand of coppers, besides five pounds of\\nmy wife's money.  This money I got by cleaning gentlemen's shoes and\\ndrawing boots, by catching musk-rats and minks, raising potatoes and\\ncarrots, &c. and by fishing in the night, and at odd spells.\\n\\nAll this money amounting to near twenty-one pounds York currency, my\\nmaster's brother, Robert Stanton, hired of me, for which he gave me\\nhis note.  About one year and a half after that time, my master\\npurchased my wife and and her child, for severn hundred pounds old\\ntenor.  One time my master sent me two miles after a barrel of\\nmolasses, and ordered me to carry it on my shoulders.  I made out to\\ncarry it all the way to my master's house.  When I lived with Captain\\nGeorge Mumford, only to try my strength, I took up on my knees a\\ntierce of salt containing seven bushels, and carried it two or three\\nrods.  Of this fact there are several eye witnesses now living.\\n\\nTowards the close of the time that I resided with this master, I had a\\nfalling out with my mistress.  This happened one time when my master\\nwas gone to Long-Island a gunning.  At first the quarrel began between\\nmy wife and her mistress.  I was then at work in the barn, and hearing\\na racket in the house, induced me to run there and see what had broken\\nout.  When I entered the house, I found my mistress in a violent\\npassion with my wife, for what she informed me was a mere trifle; such\\na small affair that I forbear to put my mistress to the shame of\\nhaving it known.  I earnestly requested my wife to beg pardon of her\\nmistress for the sake of peace even if she had given no just occasion\\nfor offence.  But whilst I was thus saying my mistress turned the\\nblows which she was repeating on my wife to me.  She took down her\\nhorse-whip, and while she was glutting her fury with it, I reached out\\nmy great black hand, raised it up and received the blows of the whip\\non it which were designed for my head.  Then I immediately committed\\nthe whip to the devouring fire.\\n\\nWhen my master returned from the island, his wife told him of the\\naffair, but for the present he seemed to take no notice of it, and\\nmentioned not a word of it to me.  Some days after his return, in the\\nmorning as I was putting on a log in the fire-place, not suspecting\\nharm from any one, I received a most violent stroke on the crown of my\\nhead with a club two feet long and and as large around as a chair-\\npost.  This blow very badly wounded my head, and the scar of it\\nremains to this day.  The first blow made me have my wits about me as\\nyou may suppose, for as soon as he went to renew it, I snatched the\\nclub out of his hands and dragged him out of the door.  He then sent\\nfor his brother to come and assist him, but I presently left my\\nmaster, took the club he wounded me with, carried it to a neighboring\\nJustice of the Peace, and complained of my master.  He finally advised\\nme to return to my master, and live contented with him until he abused\\nme again, and then complain.  I consented to do accordingly.  But\\nbefore I set out for my master's, up he come and his brother Robert\\nafter me.  The Justice improved this convenient opportunity to caution\\nmy master.  He asked him for what he treated his slave thus hastily\\nand unjustly, and told him what would be the consequence if he\\ncontinued the same treatment towards me.  After the Justice had ended\\nhis discourse with my master, he and his brother set out with me for\\nhome, one before and the other behind me.  When they had come to a bye\\nplace, they both dismounted their respective horses, and fell to\\nbeating me with great violence.  I became enraged at this and\\nimmediately turned them both under me, laid one of them across the\\nother, and stamped both with my feet what I would.\\n\\nThis occasioned my master's brother to advise him to put me off.  A\\nshort time after this I was taken by a constable and two men.  They\\ncarried me to a black-smith's shop and had me hand-cuffed.  When I\\nreturned home my mistress enquired much of her waiters, whether\\nVENTURE was hand-cuffed.  When she was informed that I was, she\\nappeared to be very contented and was much transported with the news.\\nIn the midst of all this content and joy, I presented myself before my\\nmistress, shewed her my hand-cuffs, and gave her thanks for my gold\\nrings.  For this my master commanded a negro of his to fetch him a\\nlarge ox chain.  This my master locked on my legs with two padlocks.\\nI continued to wear the chain peaceably for two or three days, when my\\nmaster asked me with contemptuous hard names whether I had not better\\nbe freed from my chains and go to work.  I answered him, No.  Well\\nthen, said he, I will send you to the West-Indies or banish you, for I\\nam resolved not to keep you.  I answered him I crossed the waters to\\ncome here, and I am willing to cross them to return.\\n\\nFor a day or two after this not any one said much to me, until one\\nHempsted Miner, of Stonington, asked me if I would live with him.  I\\nanswered him that I would.  He then requested me to make myself\\ndiscontented and to appear as unreconciled to my master as I could\\nbefore that he bargained with him for me; and that in return he would\\ngive me a good chance to gain my freedom when I came to live with him.\\nI did as he requested me.  Not long after Hempsted Miner purchased me\\nof my master for fifty-six pounds lawful.  He took the chain and\\npadlocks off me immediately after.\\n\\nIt may here be remembered, that I related a few pages back, that I\\nhired out a sum of money to Mr. Robert Stanton, and took his note for\\nit.  In the fray between my master Stanton and myself, he broke open\\nmy chest containing his brother's note to me, and destroyed it.\\nImmediately after my present master bought me, he determined to sell\\nme at Hartford.  As soon as I became apprized of it, I bethought\\nmyself that I would secure a certain sum of money which lay by me,\\nsafer than to hire it out to Stanton.  Accordingly I buried it in the\\nearth, a little distance from Thomas Stanton's, in the road over which\\nhe passed daily.  A short time after my master carried me to Hartford,\\nand first proposed to sell me to one William Hooker of that place.\\nHooker asked whether I would go to the German Flats with him.  I\\nanswered, No.  He said I should, if not by fair means I should by\\nfoul.  If you will go by no other measures, I will tie you down in my\\nsleigh.  I replied to him, that if he carried me in that manner, no\\nperson would purchase me, for it would be thought that he had a\\nmurderer for sale.  After this he tried no more, and said he would not\\nhave me as a gift.\\n\\nMy master next offered me to Daniel Edwards, Esq. of Hartford, for\\nsale.  But not purchasing me, my master pawned me to him for ten\\npounds, and returned to Stonington.  After some trial of my honesty,\\nMr. Edwards placed considerable trust and confidence in me.  He put me\\nto serve as his cup-bearer and waiter.  When there was company at his\\nhouse, he would send me into his cellar and other parts of his house\\nto fetch wine and other articles occasionally for them.  When I had\\nbeen with him for some time, he asked me why my master wished to part\\nwith such an honest negro, and why he did not keep me himself.  I\\nreplied that I could not give him the reason, unless it was to convert\\nme into cash, and speculate with me as with other commodities.  I hope\\nhe can never justly say it was on account of my ill conduct that he\\ndid no keep me himself.  Mr Edwards told me that he should be very\\nwilling to keep me himself, and that he would never let me go from him\\nto live, if it was not unreasonable and inconvenient for me to be\\nparted from my wife and children; therefore he would furnish me with a\\nhorse to return to Stonington, if I had a mind for it.  As Miner did\\nnot appear to redeem me I went, at called at my old master Stanton's\\nfirst to see my wife, who was then owned by him. As my old master\\nappeared much ruffled at my being there, I left my wife before I had\\nspent considerable time with her, and went to Colonel O. Smith's.\\nMiner had not as yet wholly settled with Stanton for me, and had\\nbefore my return from Hartford given Col. Smith a bill of sale for me.\\nThese men once met to determine which of them should hold me, and upon\\nmy expressing a desire to be owned by Col. Smith, and upon my master's\\nsettling the remainder of the money which was due Stanton for me, it\\nwas agreed that I should live with Col. Smith.  This was the third\\ntime of my being sold, and I was then thirty-one years old.  As I\\nnever had an opportunity of redeeming myself whilst I was owned by\\nMiner, though he promised to give me a chance, I was then very\\nambitious of obtaining it.  I asked my master one time if he would\\nconsent to have me purchase my freedom.  He replied that he would.  I\\nwas then very happy, knowing that I was at that time able to pay part\\nof the purchase money, by means of the money which I some time since\\nburied.  This I took out of the earth and tendered to my master,\\nhaving previously engaged a free negro man to take take his security\\nfor it, as I was the property of my master, and therefore could not\\nsafely take his obligation myself.  What was wanted in redeeming\\nmyself, my master agreed to wait on me for, until I could procure it\\nfor him.  I still continued to work for Col. Smith.  Ther was\\ncontinually some interest accruing on my master's note to my friend\\nthe free negro man above named, which I received, and with some\\nbesides which I got by fishing, I laid out in land adjoining my old\\nmaster Stanton's.  By cultivating this land with the greatest\\ndiligence and economy, at times when my master did not require my\\nlabor, in two years I laid up ten pounds.  This my friend tendered to\\nmy master for myself, and received his note for it.\\n\\nBeing encouraged by the success which I had met in redeeming myself, I\\nagain solicited my master for a further chance of completing it.  The\\nchance for which I solicited him was that of going out to work the\\nensuing winter.  He agreed to this on condition that I would give him\\none quarter of my earnings.  On these terms I worked the following\\nwinter, and earned four pounds sixteen shillings, one quarter of which\\nwent to my master for the privilege, and the rest was paid him on my\\nown account.  This added to the other payments made up forty four\\npounds, eight shillings, which I had paid on my own account.  I was\\nthen about thirty five years old.\\n\\nThe next summer I again desired he would give me a chance of going out\\nto work.  But he refused and answered that he must have my labor this\\nsummer, as he did not have it the past winter.  I replied that I\\nconsidered it as hard that I could not have a chance to work out when\\nthe season became advantageous, and that I must only be permitted to\\nhire myself out in the poorest season of the year.  He asked me after\\nthis what I would give for the privilege per month.  I replied that I\\nwould leave it wholly with his own generosity to determine what I\\nshould return him a month.  Well then, said he, if so two pounds a\\nmonth.  I answered him that if that was the least he would take I\\nwould be contented.\\n\\nAccordingly, I hired myself out at Fisher's Island, and earned twenty\\npounds; thirteen pounds six shillings of which my master drew for the\\nprivilege, and the remainder I paid him for my freedom.  This made\\nfifty-one pounds two shillings which I paid him.  In October following\\nI went and wrought six months at Long Island.  In that six months'\\ntime I cut and corded four hundred cords of wood, besides threshing\\nout seventy-five bushels of grain, and received of my wages down only\\ntwenty pounds, which left remaining a larger sum.  Whilst I was out\\nthat time, I took upon my wages only one pair of shoes.  At night I\\nlay upon the hearth, with one coverlet over and another under me.  I\\nreturned to my master and gave him what I received on my six months\\nlabor.  This left only thirteen pounds eighteen shillings to make up\\nthe full sum for my redemption.  My master liberated me, saying I\\nmight pay what was behind if I could ever make it convenient,\\notherwise it would be well.  The amount of the money which I had paid\\nmy master towards redeeming my time, was seventy-one pounds two\\nshillings.  The reason of my master for asking such an unreasonable\\nprice, was he said, to secure himself in case I should ever come to\\nwant.  Being thirty-six years old, I left Col. Smith once for all.  I\\nhad already been sold three different times, made considerable money\\nwith seemingly nothing to derive it from, been cheated out of a large\\nsum of money, lost much by misfortunes, and paid an enormous sum for\\nmy freedom.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\n_Containing an account of his life, from the time of his purchasing his\\n                freedom to the present day._\\n\\nMy wife and children were yet in bondage to Mr. Thomas Stanton.  About\\nthis time I lost a chest, containing besides clothing, about thirty-\\neight pounds in paper money.  It was burnt by accident.  A short time\\nafter I sold all my possessions at Stonington, consisting of a pretty\\npiece of land and one dwelling house thereon, and went to reside at\\nLong-Island.  For the first four years of my residence there, I spent\\nmy time in working for various people on that and at the neighboring\\nislands.  I the space of six months I cut and corded upwards of four\\nhundred cords of wood.  Many other singular and wonderful labors I\\nperformed in cutting wood there, which would not be inferior to those\\njust recited, but for brevity sake I must omit them.  In the\\naforementioned four years what wood I cut at Long-Island amounted to\\nseveral thousand cords, and the money which I earned thereby amounted\\nto two hundred and seven pounds ten shillings.  This money I laid up\\ncarefully by me.  Perhaps some may enquire what maintained me all the\\ntime I was laying up money.  I would inform them that I bought nothing\\nwhich I did not absolutely want.  All fine clothes I despised in\\ncomparison with my interest, and never kept but just what clothes were\\ncomfortable for common days, and perhaps I would have a garment or two\\nwhich I did not have on at all times, but as for superfluous finery I\\nnever thought it to be compared with a decent homespun dress, a good\\nsupply of money and prudence.  Expensive gatherings of my mates I\\ncommonly shunned, and all kinds of luxuries I was perfectly a stranger\\nto; and during the time I was employed in cutting the aforementioned\\nquantity of wood, I never was at the expense of six-pence worth of\\nspirits.  Being after this labor forty years of age, I worked at\\nvarious places, and in particular on Ram-Island, which I purchased\\nSolomon and Cuff, two sons of mine, for two hundred dollars each.\\n\\nIt will here be remembered how much money I earned by cutting wood in\\nfour years.  Besides this I had considerable money, amounting in all\\nto near three hundred pounds.  After this I purchased a negro man, for\\nno other reason than to oblige him, and gave him sixty pounds.  But in\\na short time after he run away from me, and I thereby lost all that I\\ngave for him, except twenty pounds which he paid me previous to his\\nabsconding.  The rest of my money I laid out in land, in addition to a\\nfarm which I owned before, and a dwelling house thereon.  Forty four\\nyears had then completed their revolution since my entrance in to this\\nexistence of servitude and misfortune.  Solomon my eldest son, being\\nthen in his seventeenth year, and all my hope and dependence for help,\\nI hired him out to one Charles Church, of Rhode Island, for one year,\\non consideration of his giving him twelve pounds and an opportunity of\\nacquiring some learning.  In the course of the year, Church fitted out\\na vessel for a whaling voyage, and being in want of hands to man her,\\nhe induced my son to go, with the promise of giving him, on his\\nreturn, a pair of silver buckles, besides his wages.  As soon as I\\nheard of his going to sea, I immediately set out to go and prevent it\\nif possible.  But on my arrival at Church's, to my great grief, I\\ncould only see the vessel my son was on almost out of sight going to\\nsea.  My son died of the scurvy on this voyage, and Church has never\\nyet paid me the least of his wages.  In my son, besides the loss of\\nhis life, I lost equal to seventy-five pounds.\\n\\nMy other son being but a youth, still lived with me.  About this time\\nI chartered a sloop of about thirty tons burthen, and hired men to\\nassist me in navigating her.  I employed her mostly in the wood trade\\nto Rhode-Island, and made clear of all expenses above one hundred\\ndollars with her in better than one year.  I had then become something\\nforehanded, and being in my forty-fourth year, I purchased my wife\\nMeg, and thereby prevented having another child to buy, as she was\\nthen pregnant.  I gave forty pounds for her.\\n\\nDuring my residence at Long-Island, I raised one year with another,\\nten cart loads of water-melons, and lost a great many every year\\nbesides by the thievishness of the sailors.  What I made by the water-\\nmelons I sold there, amounted to nearly five hundred dollars.  Various\\nother methods I in order to enable me to redeem my family.  In the\\nnight-time I fished with set-nets and pots for eels and lobsters, and\\nshortly after went a whaling voyage in the service of Col. Smith.\\nAfter being seven months, the vessel returned, laden with four hundred\\nbarrels of oil.  About this time, I became possessed of another\\ndwelling-house, and my temporal affairs were in a pretty prosperous\\ncondition.  This and my industry was what alone saved me from being\\nexpelled that part of the island in which I resided, as an act was\\npassed by the select-men of the place, that all negroes residing there\\nshould be expelled.\\n\\nNext after my wife, I purchased a negro man for four hundred dollars.\\nBut he having an inclination to return to his old master, I therefore\\nlet him go.  Shortly after I purchased another negro man for twenty-\\nfive pounds, who I parted with shortly after.\\n\\nBeing about forty-six years old, I bought my oldest child Hannah, of\\nRay Mumford, for forty-four pounds, and she still resided with him.  I\\nhad already redeemed from slavery, myself, my wife and three children,\\nbesides three negro men.\\n\\nAbout the forty-seventh year of my life, I disposed all my property at\\nLong-Island, and came from thence into East-Haddam.  I hired myself\\nout at first to Timothy Chapman, for five weeks, the earnings of which\\ntime I put carefully by me.  After this I wrought for Abel Bingham\\nabout six weeks.  I then put my money together and purchased of said\\nBingham ten acres of land, lying at Haddam neck, where I now reside.\\nOn this land I labored with great diligence for two years, and shortly\\nafter purchased six acres more of land contiguous to my other.  One\\nyear from that time I purchased seventy acres more of the same man,\\nand paid for it mostly with the produce of my other land.  Soon after\\nI bought this lot of land, I set up a comfortable dwelling house on my\\nfarm, and built it from the produce thereof.  Shortly after I had much\\ntrouble and expense with my daughter Hannah, whose name has before\\nbeen mentioned in this account.  She was married soon after I redeemed\\nher, to one Isaac, a free negro, and shortly after her marriage fell\\nsick of a mortal disease; her husband a dissolute and abandoned\\nwretch, paid but little attention to her in her illness.  I therefore\\nthought it best to bring her to my house and nurse her there.  I\\nprocured her all the aid mortals could afford, but notwithstanding\\nthis she fell a prey to her disease, after a lingering and painful\\nendurance of it.\\n\\nThe physician's bills for attending her during her illness amounted to\\nforty pounds.  Having reached my fifty-fourth year, I hired two negro\\nmen, one named William Jacklin, and the other Mingo.  Mingo lived with\\nme one year, and having received his wages, run in debt to me eight\\ndollars, for which he gave me his note.  I procured a warrant, took\\nhim, and requested him to go to Justice Throop's of his own accord,\\nbut he refusing, I took him on my shoulders, and carried him there,\\ndistant about two miles.  The justice asking me if I had my prisoner's\\nnote with me, and replying that I had not, he told me that I must\\nreturn with him and get it.  Accordingly I carried Mingo back on my\\nshoulders, but before we arrived at my dwelling, he complained of\\nbeing hurt, and asked me if this was not a hard way of treating our\\nfellow creatures.  I answered him that it would be hard thus to treat\\nour honest fellow creatures.  He then told me that if I would let him\\noff my shoulders, he had a pair of silver shoe-buckles, one shirt and\\na pocket handkerchief, which he would turn out to me.  I agreed, and\\nlet him return home with me on foot; but the very following night, he\\nslipped from me, stole my horse and has never paid me even his note.\\nThe other negro man, Jacklin, being a comb-maker by trade, he\\nrequested me to set him up, and promised to reward me well with his\\nlabor.  Accordingly I bought him a set of tools for making combs, and\\nprocured him stock.  He worked at my house about one year, and then\\nrun away from me with all his combs, and owed me for all his board.\\n\\nSince my residence at Haddam neck, I have owned of boats, canoes and\\nsail vessels, not less than twenty.  These I mostly employed in the\\nfishing and trafficking business, and in these occupations I have been\\ncheated out of considerable money by people whom I traded with taking\\nadvantage of my ignorance of numbers.\\n\\nAbout twelve years ago, I hired a whale-boat and four black men, and\\nproceeded to Long-Island after a load of round clams.  Having arrived\\nthere, I first purchased of James Webb, son of Orange Webb, six\\nhundred and sixty clams, and afterwards, with the help of my men,\\nfinished loading my boat.  The same evening, however, this Webb stole\\nmy boat, and went in her to Connecticut river, and sold her cargo for\\nhis own benefit.  I thereupon pursued him, and at length, after an\\nadditional expence of nine crowns, recovered the boat; but for the\\nproceeds of her cargo I never could obtain any compensation.\\n\\nFour years after, I met with another loss, far superior to this in\\nvalue, and I think by no less wicked means.  Being going to New-London\\nwith a grand-child, I took passage on an Indian's boat, and went there\\nwith him.  On our return, the Indian took on board two hogsheads of\\nmolasses, one of which belonged to Capt. Elisha Hart, of Saybrook, to\\nbe delivered to his wharf.  When we arrived there, and while I was\\ngone, at the request of the Indian, to inform Captain Hart of his\\narrival, and receive the freight for him, one hogshead of the molasses\\nhad been lost overboard by the people in attempting to land it on the\\nwharf.  Although I was absent at the time, and had no concern whatever\\nin the business, and was known to a number of respectable witnesses, I\\nwas nevertheless persecuted by this conscientious gentleman, (the\\nIndian not being able to pay for it) and obliged to pay upwards of ten\\npounds lawful money, with all the costs of court.  I applied to\\nseveral gentlemen for counsel in this affair, and they advised me, as\\nmy adversary was rich, and threatened to carry the matter from court\\nto court till it would cost me more than the first damages would be,\\nto pay the sum and submit to the injury; which I accordingly did, and\\nhe has often since insultingly taunted me with my unmerited\\nmisfortune.  Such a proceeding as this, committed on a defenseless\\nstranger, almost worn out in the hard service of the world, without\\nany foundation in reason or justice, whatever it may be called in a\\nchristian land, would in my native country be branded a crime equal to\\nhighway robbery.  But Captain Hart was a _white gentleman_, and I a\\n_poor African,_ and therefore it was _all right, and good enough for\\nthe black dog._\\n\\nI am now sixty nine years old.  Though once straight and tall,\\nmeasuring without shoes six feet one inch and an half, and every way\\nwell proportioned, I am now bowed down with age and hardship.  My\\nstrength which was once equal if not superior to any man whom I have\\never seen, is now enfeebled so that life is a burden, and it is with\\nfatigue that I can walk a couple of miles, stooping over my staff.\\nOther griefs are still behind; on account of which some aged people,\\nat least, will pity me.  My eye-sight has gradually failed, till I am\\nalmost blind, and whenever I go abroad one of my grand-children must\\ndirect my way; besides for many years I have been much pained and\\ntroubled with an ulcer on one of my legs. But amidst all my griefs and\\npains, I have many consolations; Meg, the wife of my youth, whom I\\nmarried for love, and bought with my money, is still alive.  My\\nfreedom is a privilege which nothing else can equal.  Notwithstanding\\nall the losses I have suffered by fire, by the injustice of knaves, by\\nthe cruelty and oppression of false-hearted friends, and the perfidy\\nof my own countrymen whom I have assisted and redeemed from bondage, I\\nam no possessed of more than two hundred acres of land, and three\\nhabitable dwelling houses.  I gives me joy to think that I _have_ and\\nthat I _deserve_ so good a character, especially for _truth_ and\\n_integrity._  While I am now looking to the grave as my home, my joy\\nfor this world would be full--IF my children, Cuff for whom I paid two\\nhundred dollars when a boy, and Solomon who was born soon after I\\npurchased his mother--If Cuff and Solomon--O! that they had walked the\\nway of their father.  But a father's lips are closed in silence and\\ngrief!  Vanity of vanities, all is vanity!\\n\\n                         F I N I S.\\n\\n\\n\\nCERTIFICATE.\\n\\nStonington, November 3, 1798.\\n\\nThese certify that VENTURE, a free negro man, aged about 69 years, and\\nwas, as we have ever understood, a native of Africa, and formerly a\\nslave to Mr. James Mumford, of Fisher's-Island, in the state of New-\\nYork, who sold him to Mr. Robert Stanton, 2d, of Stonington, in the\\nstate of Connecticut, and said Stanton sold said VENTURE to Col.\\nOliver Smith, of the aforesaid place.  That said VENTURE hath\\nsustained the character of a faithful servant, and that of a\\ntemperate, honest and industrious man, and being ever intent on\\nobtaining his freedom, he was indulged by his masters after the\\nordinary labour on the days of his servitude, to improve the nights in\\nfishing and other employments of his own emolument, in which time he\\nprocured so much money as to purchase his freedom from his late master\\nCol. Smith; after which he took upon himself the name of VENTURE\\nSMITH, and has since his freedom purchased a negro woman, called Meg,\\nto whom he was previously married, and also his children who were\\nslaves, and said VENTURE has since removed himself and family to the\\ntown of East-Haddam, in this state, where he has purchased lands on\\nwhich he hath built a house, and there taken up his abode.\\n\\n                                       NATHAN MINOR, Esq.\\n                                      ELIJAH PALMER, Esq.\\n                                       Capt.

      "I was born at Dukandarra, in Guinea, about the year 1729.  My father's\n",
      "name was Saungm Furro, Prince of the Tribe of Dukandarra.  My father\n",
      "had three wives.  Polygamy was not uncommon in that country,\n",
      "especially among the rich, as every man was allowed to keep as many\n",
      "wives as he could maintain.  By his first wife he had three children.\n",
      "The eldest of them was myself, named by my father Broteer.  The other\n",
      "two were named Cundazo and Soozaduka.  My father had two children by\n",
      "his second wife, and one by his third.  I descended from a very large,\n",
      "tall and stout race of beings, much larger than the generality of\n",
      "people in other parts of the globe, being commonly considerably above\n",
      "six feet in height, and in every way well proportioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing worthy of notice which I remember was, a contention\n",
      "between my father and mother, on account of my father's marrying his\n",
      "third wife without the consent of his first and eldest, which was\n",
      "contrary to the custom generally observed among my countrymen.  In\n",
      "consequence of this rupture, my mother left her husband and country,\n",
      "and travelled away with her three children to the eastward.  I was\n",
      "then five years old.  She took not the least sustenance along with\n",
      "her, to support either herself or children.  I was able to travel\n",
      "along by her side; the other two of her offspring she carried one on\n",
      "her back, and the other being a sucking child, in her arms.  When we\n",
      "became hungry, my mother used to set us down on the ground, and gather\n",
      "some of the fruits which grew spontaneously in that climate.  These\n",
      "served us for food on the way.  At night we all lay down together in\n",
      "the most secure place we could find, and reposed ourselves until\n",
      "morning.  Though there were many noxious animals there; yet so kind\n",
      "was our Almighty protector, that none of them were ever permitted to\n",
      "hurt or molest us.  Thus we went on our journey until the second day\n",
      "after our departure from Dukandarra, when we came to the entrance of a\n",
      "great desert.  During our travel in that we were often affrighted with\n",
      "the doleful howlings and yellings of wolves, lions, and other animals.\n",
      "After five days travel we came to the end of this desert, and\n",
      "immediately entered into a beautiful and extensive interval country.\n",
      "Here my mother was pleased to stop and seek a refuge for me.  She left\n",
      "me at the house of a very rich farmer.  I was then, I should judge,\n",
      "not less than one hundred forty miles from my native place, separated\n",
      "from all my relations and acquaintance.  At this place my mother took\n",
      "her farewell of me, and set out for her own country.  My new guardian,\n",
      "as I shall call the man with whom I was left, put me into the business\n",
      "of tending sheep, immediately after I was left with him.  The flock\n",
      "which I kept with the assistance of a boy, consisted of about forty.\n",
      "We drove them every morning between two and three miles to pasture,\n",
      "into the wide and delightful plains.  When night drew on, we drove\n",
      "them home and secured them in the cote.  In this round I continued\n",
      "during my stay there.  One incident that befel me when I was driving\n",
      "my flock from pasture, was so dreadful to me at that age, and is to\n",
      "this time fresh in my memory, that I cannot help noticing it in this\n",
      "place.  Two large dogs sallied out of a certain house and set upon me.\n",
      "One of them took me by the arm, and the other by the thigh, and before\n",
      "their master could come and relieve me, they lacerated my flesh to\n",
      "such a degree, that the scars are very visible to the present day.  My\n",
      "master was immediately sent for.  He came and carried me home, as I\n",
      "was unable to go myself on account of my wounds.  Nothing remarkable\n",
      "happened afterwards until my father sent for me to return home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before I dismiss this country, I must just inform my reader what I\n",
      "remember concerning this place.  A large river runs through this\n",
      "country in a westerly course.  The land for a great way on each side\n",
      "is flat and level, hedged in by a considerable rise of the country at\n",
      "a great distance from it.  It scarce ever rains there, yet the land is\n",
      "fertile; great dews fall in the night which refresh the soil.  About\n",
      "the latter end of June or first of July, the river begins to rise, and\n",
      "gradually increases until it has inundated the country for a great\n",
      "distance, to a height of seven or eight feet.  This brings on a slime\n",
      "which enriches the land surprisingly.  When the river has subsided,\n",
      "the natives begin to sow and plant, and the vegetation is exceedingly\n",
      "rapid.  Near this rich river my guardian's land lay.  He possessed, I\n",
      "cannot tell exactly how much, yet this I am certain of respecting it,\n",
      "that he owned an immense tract.  He possessed likewise a great many\n",
      "cattle and goats.  During my stay with him I was kindly used, and with\n",
      "as much tenderness, for what I saw, as his only son, although I was an\n",
      "entire stranger to him, remote from friends and relations.  The\n",
      "principal occupation of the inhabitants there, were the cultivation of\n",
      "the soil and the care of their flocks.  They were a people pretty\n",
      "similar in every respect to that of mine,  except in their persons,\n",
      "which were not so tall and stout.  They appeared to be very kind and\n",
      "friendly.  I will now return to my departure from that place.\n",
      "\n",
      "My father sent a man and horse after me.  After settling with my\n",
      "guardian for keeping me, he took me away and went for home.  It was\n",
      "then about one year since my mother brought me here.  Nothing\n",
      "remarkable occured to us on our journey until we arrived safe home.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found then that the difference between my parents had been made up\n",
      "previous to their sending for me.  On my return, I was received both\n",
      "by my father and mother with great joy and affection, and was once\n",
      "more restored to my paternal dwelling in peace and happiness.  I was\n",
      "then about six years old.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not more than six weeks had passed after my return, before a message\n",
      "was brought by an inhabitant of the place where I lived the preceding\n",
      "year to my father, that that place had been invaded by a numerous\n",
      "army, from a nation not far distant, furnished with musical\n",
      "instruments, and all kinds of arms then in use; that they were\n",
      "instigated by some white nation who equipped and sent them to subdue\n",
      "and possess the country, that his nation had made no preparation for\n",
      "war, having been for a long time in profound peace that they could not\n",
      "defend themselves against such a formidable train of invaders, and\n",
      "must therefore necessarily evacuate their lands to the fierce enemy,\n",
      "and fly to the protection of some chief; and that if he would permit\n",
      "them they should come under his rule and protection when they had to\n",
      "retreat from their own possessions.  He was a kind and merciful\n",
      "prince, and therefore consented to these proposals.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had scarcely returned to his nation with the message, before the\n",
      "whole of his people were obliged to retreat from their country, and\n",
      "come to my fathers dominions.\n",
      "\n",
      "He gave them every privilege and all the protection his government\n",
      "could afford.  But they had not been there longer than four days\n",
      "before news came to them that the invaders had laid waste their\n",
      "country, and were coming speedily to destroy them in my father's\n",
      "territories. This affrighted them, and therefore they immediately\n",
      "pushed off to the southward, into the unknown countries there, and\n",
      "were never more heard of.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two days after their retreat, the report turned out to be but too\n",
      "true.  A detachment of the enemy came to my father and informed him,\n",
      "that the whole army was encamped not far out of his dominions, and\n",
      "would invade the territory and deprive his people of their liberties\n",
      "and rights, if he did not comply with the following terms.  These were\n",
      "to pay them a large sum of money, three hundred fat cattle, and a\n",
      "great number of goats, sheep, asses, &c.\n",
      "\n",
      "My father told the messenger that he would comply rather than that his\n",
      "subjects should be deprived of their rights and privileges, which he\n",
      "was not then in circumstances to defend from so sudden an invasion.\n",
      "Upon turning out those articles, the enemy pledged their faith and\n",
      "honor that they would not attack him.  On these he relied and\n",
      "therefore thought it unnecessary to be on his guard against the enemy.\n",
      "But their pledges of faith and honor proved no better than those of\n",
      "other unprincipled hostile nations; for a few days after a certain\n",
      "relation of the king came and informed him, that the enemy who sent\n",
      "terms of accommodation to him, and received tribute to their\n",
      "satisfaction, yet meditated an attack on his subjects by surprise, and\n",
      "that probably they would commence their attack in less than one day,\n",
      "and concluded with advising him, as he was not prepared for war, to\n",
      "order a speedy retreat of his family and subjects.  He complied with\n",
      "this advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same night which was fixed upon to retreat, my father and his\n",
      "family set off about break of day.  The king and his two younger wives\n",
      "went in one company, and my mother and her children in another.  We\n",
      "left our dwellings in succession, and my father's company went on\n",
      "first.  We directed our course for a large shrub plain, some distance\n",
      "off, where we intended to conceal ourselves from the approaching\n",
      "enemy, until we could refresh and rest ourselves a little.  But we\n",
      "presently found that our retreat was not secure.  For having struck up\n",
      "a little fire for purposes of cooking victuals, the enemy who happened\n",
      "to be encamped a little distance off, had sent out a scouting party\n",
      "which discovered us by the smoke of the fire, just as we were\n",
      "extinguishing it and about to eat.  As soon as we had finished eating,\n",
      "my father discovered the party, and immediately began to discharge\n",
      "arrows at them.  This was what I first saw, and it alarmed both me and\n",
      "the women, who being unable to make any resistance, immediately betook\n",
      "ourselves to the tall thick reeds not far off, and left the old king\n",
      "to fight alone.  For some time, I beheld him from the reeds defending\n",
      "himself with  great courage and firmness, till at last he was obliged\n",
      "to surrender himself into their hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they came to us in the reeds, and the very first salute I had\n",
      "from them was a violent blow on the head with the fore part of a gun,\n",
      "and at the same time a grasp round the neck.  I then had a rope put\n",
      "about my neck, as had all the women in the thicket with me, and were\n",
      "immediately led to my father, who was likewise pinioned and haltered\n",
      "for leading.  In this condition we were all led to the camp.  The\n",
      "women and myself being pretty submissive, had tolerable treatment from\n",
      "the enemy, while my father was closely interrogated respecting his\n",
      "money which they knew he must have.  But as he gave them no account of\n",
      "it, he was instantly cut and pounded on his body with great\n",
      "inhumanity, that he might be induced by the torture he suffered to\n",
      "make the discovery.  All this availed not the least to make him give\n",
      "up his money, but he despised all the tortures which they inflicted,\n",
      "until the continued exercise and increase of torment, obliged him to\n",
      "sink and expire.  He thus died without informing his enemies of the\n",
      "place where his money lay.  I saw him while he was thus tortured to\n",
      "death.  The shocking scene is to this day fresh in my mind, and I have\n",
      "often been overcome while thinking on it.  He was a man of remarkable\n",
      "stature.  I should judge as much as six feet and six or seven inches\n",
      "high, two feet across his shoulders, and every way well proportioned.\n",
      "He as a man of remarkable strength and resolution, affable, kind and\n",
      "gentle, ruling with equity and moderation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The army of the enemy was large, I should suppose consisting of about\n",
      "six thousand men.  Their leader was called Baukurre.  After destroying\n",
      "the old prince, they decamped and immediately marched towards the sea,\n",
      "lying to the west, taking with them myself and the women prisoners.\n",
      "In the march a scouting party was detached from the main army.  To the\n",
      "leader of this party I was made waiter, having to carry his gun, &c.\n",
      "As we were a scouting we came across a herd of fat cattle, consisting\n",
      "of about thirty in number.  These we set upon, and immediately wrested\n",
      "from their keepers, and afterwards converted them into food for the\n",
      "army.  The enemy had remarkable success in destroying the country\n",
      "wherever they went.  For as far as they had penetrated, they laid the\n",
      "habitations waste and captured the people.  The distance they had now\n",
      "brought me was about four hundred miles.  All the march I had very\n",
      "hard tasks imposed on me, which I must perform on pain of punishment.\n",
      "I was obliged to carry on my head a large flat stone used for grinding\n",
      "our corn, weighing as I should suppose, as much as 25 pounds; besides\n",
      "victuals, mat and cooking utensils.  Though I was pretty large and\n",
      "stout of my age, yet these burthens were very grievous to me, being\n",
      "only about six years and a half old.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were then come to a place called Malagafco.  When we entered the\n",
      "place we could not see the least appearance of either houses or\n",
      "inhabitants, but upon stricter search found, that instead of houses\n",
      "above ground they had dens in the sides of hillocks, contiguous to\n",
      "ponds and streams of water.  In these we perceived they had all hid\n",
      "themselves, as I suppose they usually did upon such occasions.  In\n",
      "order to compel them to surrender, the enemy contrived to smoke them\n",
      "out with faggots.  These they put to the entrance of the caves and set\n",
      "them on fire.  While they were engaged in this business, to their\n",
      "great surprise some of them were desperately wounded with arrows which\n",
      "fell from above on them.  This mystery they soon found out.  They\n",
      "perceived that the enemy discharged these arrows through holes on the\n",
      "top of the dens directly in to the air.  Their weight brought them\n",
      "back, point downwards on their enemies heads, whilst they were smoking\n",
      "the inhabitants out.  The points of the arrows were poisoned, but\n",
      "their enemy had an antidote for it, which they instantly applied to\n",
      "the wounded part.  The smoke at last obliged the people to give\n",
      "themselves up.  They came out of their caves, first spatting the palms\n",
      "of their hands together, then and immediately after extended their\n",
      "arms, crossed at their wrists, ready to be bound and pinioned.  I\n",
      "should judge that the dens above mentioned were extended about eight\n",
      "feet horizontally into the earth, five feet in height and as many\n",
      "wide.  They were arched over head and lined with earth, which was of\n",
      "the clay kind, and made the surface of their walls firm and smooth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The invaders then pinioned the prisoners of all ages and sexes\n",
      "indiscriminately, took their flocks and all their effects, and moved\n",
      "on their way towards the sea.  On the march the prisoners were treated\n",
      "with clemency, on account of their being submissive and humble.\n",
      "Having come to the next tribe, the enemy laid siege and immediately\n",
      "took men, women, children, flocks, and all their valuable effects.\n",
      "They then went on to the next district which was contiguous with the\n",
      "sea, called in Africa, Anamaboo.  The enemies provisions were then\n",
      "almost spent, as well as their strength.  The inhabitants knowing what\n",
      "kind of conduct they had pursued, and what were their present\n",
      "intentions, improved the favorable opportunity, attacked them, and\n",
      "took enemy, prisoners, flocks and all their effects.  I was then taken\n",
      "a second time.  All of us were then put into the castle, and kept for\n",
      "market.  On a certain time I and other prisoners were put on board a\n",
      "canoe, under our master, and rowed away to a vessel belonging to Rhode\n",
      "Island, commanded by capt. Collingwood, and the mate Thomas Mumford.\n",
      "While we were going to the vessel, our master told us all to appear to\n",
      "the best possible advantage for sale.  I was bought on board by one\n",
      "Robertson Mumford, steward of said vessel, for four gallons of rum,\n",
      "and a piece of calico, and called VENTURE, on account of his having\n",
      "purchased me with his own private venture.  Thus I came by my name.\n",

      "of his trunks on board the vessel, and charged me not to deliver them\n",
      "up to any body, not even to his father without his orders.  To his\n",
      "directions I promised faithfully to conform.  When I arrived with my\n",
      "master's articles at his house, my master's father asked me for his\n",

      "obtain them from me, yet I mistrusted that he would take some time\n",
      "when I was off my guard, either in the day time or at night to get\n",
      "them, therefore I slung them around my neck, and in the day concealed\n",
      "them in my bosom, and at night I always lay with them under me, that\n",
      "no person might take them from me without being apprized of it.  Thus\n",

      "The first of the time of living at my master's own place, I was pretty\n",
      "much employed in the house at carding wool and other household\n",
      "business.  In this situation I continued for some years, after which\n",
      "my master put me to work out of doors.  After many proofs of my\n",
      "faithfulness and honesty, my master began to put great confidence in\n",
      "me.  My behavior to him had as yet been submissive and obedient.  I\n",

      "For my master having set me off my business to perform that day and\n",
      "then left me to perform it, his son came up to me in the course of the\n",
      "day, big with authority, and and commanded me very arrogantly to quit\n",
      "my present business and go directly about what he should order me.  I\n",
      "replied to him that my master had given me so much to perform that\n",
      "day, and that I must therefore faithfully complete it in that time.\n",
      "He then broke out in a great rage, snatched a pitchfork and went to\n",
      "lay me over the head therewith; but I as soon got another and defended\n",
      "myself with it, or otherwise he might have murdered me in his outrage.\n",
      "He immediately called some people who were hearing at work for him,\n",
      "and ordered them to take his hair rope and and come and bind me with\n",
      "it.  They all tried to bind me but in vain, tho' there were three\n",
      "assistants in number.  My upstart master than desisted, put his pocket\n",
      "handkerchief before his eyes and went home with a design to tell his\n",
      "mother of the struggle with young VENTURE.  He told her that their\n",
      "young VENTURE had become so stubborn that he could not controul him,\n",
      "and asked her what he should do with him.  In the mean time I\n",
      "recovered my temper, voluntarily caused myself to be bound by the same\n",
      "men who tried in vain before, and carried before my young master, that\n",
      "he might do what he pleased with me.  He took me to a gallows made for\n",
      "the purpose of hanging cattle on, and suspended me on it.  Afterwards\n",
      "he ordered one of his hands to go to the peach orchard and cut him\n",
      "three dozens of whips to punish me with.  These were brought to him,\n",
      "and that was all that was done with them, as I was released and went\n",
      "to work after hanging on the gallows about an hour.\n",

      "After I lived with my master thirteen years, being then about twenty\n",
      "two years old, I married Meg, a slave of his who was about my age.  My\n",
      "master owned a certain Irishman, named Heddy, who about that time\n",
      "formed a plan of secretly leaving his master.  After he had long had\n",
      "this plan in meditation he suggested it to me.  At first I cast a deaf\n",
      "ear on it, and rebuked Heddy for harboring in his mind such a rash\n",
      "undertaking.  But after he had persuaded and much enchanted me with\n",
      "the prospect of gaining my freedom with such a method, I at length\n",
      "agreed to accompany him.  Heddy next inveigled two of his fellow\n",
      "servants to accompany us.  The place to which we designed to go was\n",
      "the Mississippi.  Our next business was to lay in a sufficient store\n",
      "of provisions for our voyage.  We privately collected out of our\n",
      "master's store, six great old cheeses, two firkins of butter, and one\n",
      "whole batch of new bread.  When we had gathered all our own clothes\n",
      "and some more, we took them all about midnight, and went to the water\n",
      "side.  We stole our master's boat, embarked, then directed our course\n",
      "for the Mississippi river.\n",
      "\n",
      "We mutually confederated not to betray or desert one another on pain\n",
      "of death.  We first steered our course for Montauk point, the east end\n",
      "of Long-Island.  After our arrival there we landed, and Heddy and I\n",
      "made an incursion into the island after fresh water, while our two\n",
      "comrades were left at a little distance from the boat, employed at\n",
      "cooking.  When Heddy and I had sought some time for water, he returned\n",
      "to our companions, and I continued on looking for my object.  When\n",
      "Heddy had performed his business with our companions, who were engaged\n",
      "in cooking, he went directly to the boat, stole all the clothes in it,\n",
      "and then travelled away for East-Hampton, as I was informed.  I\n",
      "returned to my fellows not long after.  They informed me that our\n",
      "clothes were stolen, but could not determine who was the thief, yet\n",
      "they suspected Heddy as he was missing.  After reproving my two\n",
      "comrades for not taking care of our things which were in the boat, I\n",
      "advertised Heddy and sent two men in search of him.  They pursued and\n",
      "overtook him at Southampton and returned him to the boat.  I then\n",
      "thought it might afford some chance for my freedom, or at least a\n",
      "palliation for my running away, to return Heddy immediately to his\n",
      "master, and inform him that I was induced to go away by Heddy's\n",
      "address.  Accordingly I set off with him and the rest of my companions\n",
      "for our master's, and arrived there without any difficulty.  I\n",
      "informed my master that Heddy was the ringleader of our revolt, and\n",
      "that he had used us ill.  He immediately put Heddy into custody, and\n",
      "myself and companions were well received and went to work as usual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a long time passed after that, before Heddy was sent by my master\n",
      "to New-London gaol.  At the close of that year I was sold to a Thomas\n",
      "Stanton, and had to be separated from my wife and one daughter, who\n",
      "was about one month old.  He resided at Stonington-point.  To this\n",
      "place I brought with me from my last master's, two johannes, three old\n",
      "Spanish dollars, and two thousand of coppers, besides five pounds of\n",
      "my wife's money.  This money I got by cleaning gentlemen's shoes and\n",
      "drawing boots, by catching musk-rats and minks, raising potatoes and\n",
      "carrots, &c. and by fishing in the night, and at odd spells.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this money amounting to near twenty-one pounds York currency, my\n",
      "master's brother, Robert Stanton, hired of me, for which he gave me\n",
      "his note.  About one year and a half after that time, my master\n",
      "purchased my wife and and her child, for severn hundred pounds old\n",
      "tenor.  One time my master sent me two miles after a barrel of\n",
      "molasses, and ordered me to carry it on my shoulders.  I made out to\n",
      "carry it all the way to my master's house.  When I lived with Captain\n",
      "George Mumford, only to try my strength, I took up on my knees a\n",
      "tierce of salt containing seven bushels, and carried it two or three\n",
      "rods.  Of this fact there are several eye witnesses now living.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards the close of the time that I resided with this master, I had a\n",
      "falling out with my mistress.  This happened one time when my master\n",
      "was gone to Long-Island a gunning.  At first the quarrel began between\n",
      "my wife and her mistress.  I was then at work in the barn, and hearing\n",
      "a racket in the house, induced me to run there and see what had broken\n",
      "out.  When I entered the house, I found my mistress in a violent\n",
      "passion with my wife, for what she informed me was a mere trifle; such\n",
      "a small affair that I forbear to put my mistress to the shame of\n",
      "having it known.  I earnestly requested my wife to beg pardon of her\n",
      "mistress for the sake of peace even if she had given no just occasion\n",
      "for offence.  But whilst I was thus saying my mistress turned the\n",
      "blows which she was repeating on my wife to me.  She took down her\n",
      "horse-whip, and while she was glutting her fury with it, I reached out\n",
      "my great black hand, raised it up and received the blows of the whip\n",
      "on it which were designed for my head.  Then I immediately committed\n",
      "the whip to the devouring fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "When my master returned from the island, his wife told him of the\n",
      "affair, but for the present he seemed to take no notice of it, and\n",
      "mentioned not a word of it to me.  Some days after his return, in the\n",
      "morning as I was putting on a log in the fire-place, not suspecting\n",
      "harm from any one, I received a most violent stroke on the crown of my\n",
      "head with a club two feet long and and as large around as a chair-\n",
      "post.  This blow very badly wounded my head, and the scar of it\n",
      "remains to this day.  The first blow made me have my wits about me as\n",
      "you may suppose, for as soon as he went to renew it, I snatched the\n",
      "club out of his hands and dragged him out of the door.  He then sent\n",
      "for his brother to come and assist him, but I presently left my\n",
      "master, took the club he wounded me with, carried it to a neighboring\n",
      "Justice of the Peace, and complained of my master.  He finally advised\n",
      "me to return to my master, and live contented with him until he abused\n",
      "me again, and then complain.  I consented to do accordingly.  But\n",
      "before I set out for my master's, up he come and his brother Robert\n",
      "after me.  The Justice improved this convenient opportunity to caution\n",
      "my master.  He asked him for what he treated his slave thus hastily\n",
      "and unjustly, and told him what would be the consequence if he\n",
      "continued the same treatment towards me.  After the Justice had ended\n",
      "his discourse with my master, he and his brother set out with me for\n",
      "home, one before and the other behind me.  When they had come to a bye\n",
      "place, they both dismounted their respective horses, and fell to\n",
      "beating me with great violence.  I became enraged at this and\n",
      "immediately turned them both under me, laid one of them across the\n",
      "other, and stamped both with my feet what I would.\n",
      "\n",
      "This occasioned my master's brother to advise him to put me off.  A\n",
      "short time after this I was taken by a constable and two men.  They\n",
      "carried me to a black-smith's shop and had me hand-cuffed.  When I\n",
      "returned home my mistress enquired much of her waiters, whether\n",
      "VENTURE was hand-cuffed.  When she was informed that I was, she\n",
      "appeared to be very contented and was much transported with the news.\n",
      "In the midst of all this content and joy, I presented myself before my\n",
      "mistress, shewed her my hand-cuffs, and gave her thanks for my gold\n",
      "rings.  For this my master commanded a negro of his to fetch him a\n",
      "large ox chain.  This my master locked on my legs with two padlocks.\n",
      "I continued to wear the chain peaceably for two or three days, when my\n",
      "master asked me with contemptuous hard names whether I had not better\n",
      "be freed from my chains and go to work.  I answered him, No.  Well\n",
      "then, said he, I will send you to the West-Indies or banish you, for I\n",
      "am resolved not to keep you.  I answered him I crossed the waters to\n",
      "come here, and I am willing to cross them to return.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a day or two after this not any one said much to me, until one\n",
      "Hempsted Miner, of Stonington, asked me if I would live with him.  I\n",
      "answered him that I would.  He then requested me to make myself\n",
      "discontented and to appear as unreconciled to my master as I could\n",
      "before that he bargained with him for me; and that in return he would\n",
      "give me a good chance to gain my freedom when I came to live with him.\n",
      "I did as he requested me.  Not long after Hempsted Miner purchased me\n",
      "of my master for fifty-six pounds lawful.  He took the chain and\n",
      "padlocks off me immediately after.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may here be remembered, that I related a few pages back, that I\n",
      "hired out a sum of money to Mr. Robert Stanton, and took his note for\n",
      "it.  In the fray between my master Stanton and myself, he broke open\n",
      "my chest containing his brother's note to me, and destroyed it.\n",
      "Immediately after my present master bought me, he determined to sell\n",
      "me at Hartford.  As soon as I became apprized of it, I bethought\n",
      "myself that I would secure a certain sum of money which lay by me,\n",
      "safer than to hire it out to Stanton.  Accordingly I buried it in the\n",
      "earth, a little distance from Thomas Stanton's, in the road over which\n",
      "he passed daily.  A short time after my master carried me to Hartford,\n",
      "and first proposed to sell me to one William Hooker of that place.\n",
      "Hooker asked whether I would go to the German Flats with him.  I\n",
      "answered, No.  He said I should, if not by fair means I should by\n",
      "foul.  If you will go by no other measures, I will tie you down in my\n",
      "sleigh.  I replied to him, that if he carried me in that manner, no\n",
      "person would purchase me, for it would be thought that he had a\n",
      "murderer for sale.  After this he tried no more, and said he would not\n",
      "have me as a gift.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master next offered me to Daniel Edwards, Esq. of Hartford, for\n",
      "sale.  But not purchasing me, my master pawned me to him for ten\n",
      "pounds, and returned to Stonington.  After some trial of my honesty,\n",
      "Mr. Edwards placed considerable trust and confidence in me.  He put me\n",
      "to serve as his cup-bearer and waiter.  When there was company at his\n",
      "house, he would send me into his cellar and other parts of his house\n",
      "to fetch wine and other articles occasionally for them.  When I had\n",
      "been with him for some time, he asked me why my master wished to part\n",
      "with such an honest negro, and why he did not keep me himself.  I\n",
      "replied that I could not give him the reason, unless it was to convert\n",
      "me into cash, and speculate with me as with other commodities.  I hope\n",
      "he can never justly say it was on account of my ill conduct that he\n",
      "did no keep me himself.  Mr Edwards told me that he should be very\n",
      "willing to keep me himself, and that he would never let me go from him\n",
      "to live, if it was not unreasonable and inconvenient for me to be\n",
      "parted from my wife and children; therefore he would furnish me with a\n",
      "horse to return to Stonington, if I had a mind for it.  As Miner did\n",
      "not appear to redeem me I went, at called at my old master Stanton's\n",
      "first to see my wife, who was then owned by him. As my old master\n",
      "appeared much ruffled at my being there, I left my wife before I had\n",
      "spent considerable time with her, and went to Colonel O. Smith's.\n",
      "Miner had not as yet wholly settled with Stanton for me, and had\n",
      "before my return from Hartford given Col. Smith a bill of sale for me.\n",
      "These men once met to determine which of them should hold me, and upon\n",
      "my expressing a desire to be owned by Col. Smith, and upon my master's\n",
      "settling the remainder of the money which was due Stanton for me, it\n",
      "was agreed that I should live with Col. Smith.  This was the third\n",
      "time of my being sold, and I was then thirty-one years old.  As I\n",
      "never had an opportunity of redeeming myself whilst I was owned by\n",
      "Miner, though he promised to give me a chance, I was then very\n",
      "ambitious of obtaining it.  I asked my master one time if he would\n",
      "consent to have me purchase my freedom.  He replied that he would.  I\n",
      "was then very happy, knowing that I was at that time able to pay part\n",
      "of the purchase money, by means of the money which I some time since\n",
      "buried.  This I took out of the earth and tendered to my master,\n",
      "having previously engaged a free negro man to take take his security\n",
      "for it, as I was the property of my master, and therefore could not\n",
      "safely take his obligation myself.  What was wanted in redeeming\n",
      "myself, my master agreed to wait on me for, until I could procure it\n",
      "for him.  I still continued to work for Col. Smith.  Ther was\n",
      "continually some interest accruing on my master's note to my friend\n",
      "the free negro man above named, which I received, and with some\n",
      "besides which I got by fishing, I laid out in land adjoining my old\n",
      "master Stanton's.  By cultivating this land with the greatest\n",
      "diligence and economy, at times when my master did not require my\n",
      "labor, in two years I laid up ten pounds.  This my friend tendered to\n",
      "my master for myself, and received his note for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being encouraged by the success which I had met in redeeming myself, I\n",
      "again solicited my master for a further chance of completing it.  The\n",
      "chance for which I solicited him was that of going out to work the\n",
      "ensuing winter.  He agreed to this on condition that I would give him\n",
      "one quarter of my earnings.  On these terms I worked the following\n",
      "winter, and earned four pounds sixteen shillings, one quarter of which\n",
      "went to my master for the privilege, and the rest was paid him on my\n",
      "own account.  This added to the other payments made up forty four\n",
      "pounds, eight shillings, which I had paid on my own account.  I was\n",
      "then about thirty five years old.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next summer I again desired he would give me a chance of going out\n",
      "to work.  But he refused and answered that he must have my labor this\n",
      "summer, as he did not have it the past winter.  I replied that I\n",
      "considered it as hard that I could not have a chance to work out when\n",
      "the season became advantageous, and that I must only be permitted to\n",
      "hire myself out in the poorest season of the year.  He asked me after\n",
      "this what I would give for the privilege per month.  I replied that I\n",
      "would leave it wholly with his own generosity to determine what I\n",
      "should return him a month.  Well then, said he, if so two pounds a\n",
      "month.  I answered him that if that was the least he would take I\n",
      "would be contented.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, I hired myself out at Fisher's Island, and earned twenty\n",
      "pounds; thirteen pounds six shillings of which my master drew for the\n",
      "privilege, and the remainder I paid him for my freedom.  This made\n",
      "fifty-one pounds two shillings which I paid him.  In October following\n",
      "I went and wrought six months at Long Island.  In that six months'\n",
      "time I cut and corded four hundred cords of wood, besides threshing\n",
      "out seventy-five bushels of grain, and received of my wages down only\n",
      "twenty pounds, which left remaining a larger sum.  Whilst I was out\n",
      "that time, I took upon my wages only one pair of shoes.  At night I\n",
      "lay upon the hearth, with one coverlet over and another under me.  I\n",
      "returned to my master and gave him what I received on my six months\n",
      "labor.  This left only thirteen pounds eighteen shillings to make up\n",
      "the full sum for my redemption.  My master liberated me, saying I\n",
      "might pay what was behind if I could ever make it convenient,\n",
      "otherwise it would be well.  The amount of the money which I had paid\n",
      "my master towards redeeming my time, was seventy-one pounds two\n",
      "shillings.  The reason of my master for asking such an unreasonable\n",
      "price, was he said, to secure himself in case I should ever come to\n",
      "want.  Being thirty-six years old, I left Col. Smith once for all.  I\n",
      "had already been sold three different times, made considerable money\n",
      "with seemingly nothing to derive it from, been cheated out of a large\n",
      "sum of money, lost much by misfortunes, and paid an enormous sum for\n",

      "after I sold all my possessions at Stonington, consisting of a pretty\n",
      "piece of land and one dwelling house thereon, and went to reside at\n",
      "Long-Island.  For the first four years of my residence there, I spent\n",
      "my time in working for various people on that and at the neighboring\n",
      "islands.  I the space of six months I cut and corded upwards of four\n",
      "hundred cords of wood.  Many other singular and wonderful labors I\n",
      "performed in cutting wood there, which would not be inferior to those\n",
      "just recited, but for brevity sake I must omit them.  In the\n",

      "several thousand cords, and the money which I earned thereby amounted\n",
      "to two hundred and seven pounds ten shillings.  This money I laid up\n",
      "carefully by me.  Perhaps some may enquire what maintained me all the\n",
      "time I was laying up money.  I would inform them that I bought nothing\n",
      "which I did not absolutely want.  All fine clothes I despised in\n",

      "comfortable for common days, and perhaps I would have a garment or two\n",

      "never thought it to be compared with a decent homespun dress, a good\n",

      "It will here be remembered how much money I earned by cutting wood in\n",

      "acquiring some learning.  In the course of the year, Church fitted out\n",
      "a vessel for a whaling voyage, and being in want of hands to man her,\n",
      "he induced my son to go, with the promise of giving him, on his\n",

      "heard of his going to sea, I immediately set out to go and prevent it\n",
      "if possible.  But on my arrival at Church's, to my great grief, I\n",
      "could only see the vessel my son was on almost out of sight going to\n",
      "sea.  My son died of the scurvy on this voyage, and Church has never\n",

      "his life, I lost equal to seventy-five pounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "My other son being but a youth, still lived with me.  About this time\n",
      "I chartered a sloop of about thirty tons burthen, and hired men to\n",

      "to Rhode-Island, and made clear of all expenses above one hundred\n",
      "dollars with her in better than one year.  I had then become something\n",
      "forehanded, and being in my forty-fourth year, I purchased my wife\n",
      "Meg, and thereby prevented having another child to buy, as she was\n",
      "then pregnant.  I gave forty pounds for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "During my residence at Long-Island, I raised one year with another,\n",
      "ten cart loads of water-melons, and lost a great many every year\n",
      "besides by the thievishness of the sailors.  What I made by the water-\n",
      "melons I sold there, amounted to nearly five hundred dollars.  Various\n",
      "other methods I in order to enable me to redeem my family.  In the\n",
      "night-time I fished with set-nets and pots for eels and lobsters, and\n",
      "shortly after went a whaling voyage in the service of Col. Smith.\n",
      "After being seven months, the vessel returned, laden with four hundred\n",
      "barrels of oil.  About this time, I became possessed of another\n",
      "dwelling-house, and my temporal affairs were in a pretty prosperous\n",
      "condition.  This and my industry was what alone saved me from being\n",
      "expelled that part of the island in which I resided, as an act was\n",
      "passed by the select-men of the place, that all negroes residing there\n",
      "should be expelled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next after my wife, I purchased a negro man for four hundred dollars.\n",
      "But he having an inclination to return to his old master, I therefore\n",
      "let him go.  Shortly after I purchased another negro man for twenty-\n",
      "five pounds, who I parted with shortly after.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being about forty-six years old, I bought my oldest child Hannah, of\n",
      "Ray Mumford, for forty-four pounds, and she still resided with him.  I\n",
      "had already redeemed from slavery, myself, my wife and three children,\n",
      "besides three negro men.\n",
      "\n",
      "About the forty-seventh year of my life, I disposed all my property at\n",
      "Long-Island, and came from thence into East-Haddam.  I hired myself\n",
      "out at first to Timothy Chapman, for five weeks, the earnings of which\n",
      "time I put carefully by me.  After this I wrought for Abel Bingham\n",
      "about six weeks.  I then put my money together and purchased of said\n",
      "Bingham ten acres of land, lying at Haddam neck, where I now reside.\n",
      "On this land I labored with great diligence for two years, and shortly\n",
      "after purchased six acres more of land contiguous to my other.  One\n",
      "year from that time I purchased seventy acres more of the same man,\n",
      "and paid for it mostly with the produce of my other land.  Soon after\n",
      "I bought this lot of land, I set up a comfortable dwelling house on my\n",
      "farm, and built it from the produce thereof.  Shortly after I had much\n",
      "trouble and expense with my daughter Hannah, whose name has before\n",
      "been mentioned in this account.  She was married soon after I redeemed\n",
      "her, to one Isaac, a free negro, and shortly after her marriage fell\n",
      "sick of a mortal disease; her husband a dissolute and abandoned\n",
      "wretch, paid but little attention to her in her illness.  I therefore\n",
      "thought it best to bring her to my house and nurse her there.  I\n",
      "procured her all the aid mortals could afford, but notwithstanding\n",
      "this she fell a prey to her disease, after a lingering and painful\n",
      "endurance of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The physician's bills for attending her during her illness amounted to\n",
      "forty pounds.  Having reached my fifty-fourth year, I hired two negro\n",
      "men, one named William Jacklin, and the other Mingo.  Mingo lived with\n",
      "me one year, and having received his wages, run in debt to me eight\n",
      "dollars, for which he gave me his note.  I procured a warrant, took\n",
      "him, and requested him to go to Justice Throop's of his own accord,\n",
      "but he refusing, I took him on my shoulders, and carried him there,\n",
      "distant about two miles.  The justice asking me if I had my prisoner's\n",
      "note with me, and replying that I had not, he told me that I must\n",
      "return with him and get it.  Accordingly I carried Mingo back on my\n",
      "shoulders, but before we arrived at my dwelling, he complained of\n",
      "being hurt, and asked me if this was not a hard way of treating our\n",
      "fellow creatures.  I answered him that it would be hard thus to treat\n",
      "our honest fellow creatures.  He then told me that if I would let him\n",
      "off my shoulders, he had a pair of silver shoe-buckles, one shirt and\n",
      "a pocket handkerchief, which he would turn out to me.  I agreed, and\n",
      "let him return home with me on foot; but the very following night, he\n",
      "slipped from me, stole my horse and has never paid me even his note.\n",
      "The other negro man, Jacklin, being a comb-maker by trade, he\n",
      "requested me to set him up, and promised to reward me well with his\n",
      "labor.  Accordingly I bought him a set of tools for making combs, and\n",
      "procured him stock.  He worked at my house about one year, and then\n",
      "run away from me with all his combs, and owed me for all his board.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since my residence at Haddam neck, I have owned of boats, canoes and\n",
      "sail vessels, not less than twenty.  These I mostly employed in the\n",
      "fishing and trafficking business, and in these occupations I have been\n",
      "cheated out of considerable money by people whom I traded with taking\n",
      "advantage of my ignorance of numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "About twelve years ago, I hired a whale-boat and four black men, and\n",
      "proceeded to Long-Island after a load of round clams.  Having arrived\n",
      "there, I first purchased of James Webb, son of Orange Webb, six\n",
      "hundred and sixty clams, and afterwards, with the help of my men,\n",
      "finished loading my boat.  The same evening, however, this Webb stole\n",
      "my boat, and went in her to Connecticut river, and sold her cargo for\n",
      "his own benefit.  I thereupon pursued him, and at length, after an\n",
      "additional expence of nine crowns, recovered the boat; but for the\n",
      "proceeds of her cargo I never could obtain any compensation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four years after, I met with another loss, far superior to this in\n",
      "value, and I think by no less wicked means.  Being going to New-London\n",
      "with a grand-child, I took passage on an Indian's boat, and went there\n",
      "with him.  On our return, the Indian took on board two hogsheads of\n",
      "molasses, one of which belonged to Capt. Elisha Hart, of Saybrook, to\n",
      "be delivered to his wharf.  When we arrived there, and while I was\n",
      "gone, at the request of the Indian, to inform Captain Hart of his\n",
      "arrival, and receive the freight for him, one hogshead of the molasses\n",
      "had been lost overboard by the people in attempting to land it on the\n",
      "wharf.  Although I was absent at the time, and had no concern whatever\n",
      "in the business, and was known to a number of respectable witnesses, I\n",
      "was nevertheless persecuted by this conscientious gentleman, (the\n",
      "Indian not being able to pay for it) and obliged to pay upwards of ten\n",
      "pounds lawful money, with all the costs of court.  I applied to\n",
      "several gentlemen for counsel in this affair, and they advised me, as\n",
      "my adversary was rich, and threatened to carry the matter from court\n",
      "to court till it would cost me more than the first damages would be,\n",
      "to pay the sum and submit to the injury; which I accordingly did, and\n",
      "he has often since insultingly taunted me with my unmerited\n",
      "misfortune.  Such a proceeding as this, committed on a defenseless\n",
      "stranger, almost worn out in the hard service of the world, without\n",
      "any foundation in reason or justice, whatever it may be called in a\n",
      "christian land, would in my native country be branded a crime equal to\n",
      "highway robbery.  But Captain Hart was a _white gentleman_, and I a\n",
      "_poor African,_ and therefore it was _all right, and good enough for\n",
      "the black dog._\n",
      "\n",
      "I am now sixty nine years old.  Though once straight and tall,\n",
      "measuring without shoes six feet one inch and an half, and every way\n",
      "well proportioned, I am now bowed down with age and hardship.  My\n",
      "strength which was once equal if not superior to any man whom I have\n",
      "ever seen, is now enfeebled so that life is a burden, and it is with\n",
      "fatigue that I can walk a couple of miles, stooping over my staff.\n",
      "Other griefs are still behind; on account of which some aged people,\n",
      "at least, will pity me.  My eye-sight has gradually failed, till I am\n",
      "almost blind, and whenever I go abroad one of my grand-children must\n",
      "direct my way; besides for many years I have been much pained and\n",
      "troubled with an ulcer on one of my legs. But amidst all my griefs and\n",

      "Many other interesting and curious passages of his life might have\n",
      "been inserted, but on account of the bulk to which they must\n",

      "should suspect the truth of what is here related, they are referred to\n",
      "people now living who are acquainted with most of the facts mentioned\n",
      "in this narrative.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reader is here presented with an account, not of a renowned\n",

      "education but what he received in common with other domesticated\n",

      "Washington, in a state of nature, or rather, in a state of slavery.\n",

      "especially among the rich, as every man was allowed to keep as many\n",
      "wives as he could maintain.  By his first wife he had three children.\n",
      "The eldest of them was myself, named by my father Broteer.  The other\n",
      "two were named Cundazo and Soozaduka.  My father had two children by\n",
      "his second wife, and one by his third.  I descended from a very large,\n",
      "tall and stout race of beings, much larger than the generality of\n",
      "people in other parts of the globe, being commonly considerably above\n",
      "six feet in height, and in every way well proportioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing worthy of notice which I remember was, a contention\n",
      "between my father and mother, on account of my father's marrying his\n",
      "third wife without the consent of his first and eldest, which was\n",
      "contrary to the custom generally observed among my countrymen.  In\n",
      "consequence of this rupture, my mother left her husband and country,\n",
      "and travelled away with her three children to the eastward.  I was\n",
      "then five years old.  She took not the least sustenance along with\n",
      "her, to support either herself or children.  I was able to travel\n",
      "along by her side; the other two of her offspring she carried one on\n",
      "her back, and the other being a sucking child, in her arms.  When we\n",
      "became hungry, my mother used to set us down on the ground, and gather\n",
      "some of the fruits which grew spontaneously in that climate.  These\n",
      "served us for food on the way.  At night we all lay down together in\n",
      "the most secure place we could find, and reposed ourselves until\n",
      "morning.  Though there were many noxious animals there; yet so kind\n",
      "was our Almighty protector, that none of them were ever permitted to\n",
      "hurt or molest us.  Thus we went on our journey until the second day\n",
      "after our departure from Dukandarra, when we came to the entrance of a\n",
      "great desert.  During our travel in that we were often affrighted with\n",
      "the doleful howlings and yellings of wolves, lions, and other animals.\n",
      "After five days travel we came to the end of this desert, and\n",
      "immediately entered into a beautiful and extensive interval country.\n",
      "Here my mother was pleased to stop and seek a refuge for me.  She left\n",
      "me at the house of a very rich farmer.  I was then, I should judge,\n",
      "not less than one hundred forty miles from my native place, separated\n",
      "from all my relations and acquaintance.  At this place my mother took\n",
      "her farewell of me, and set out for her own country.  My new guardian,\n",
      "as I shall call the man with whom I was left, put me into the business\n",
      "of tending sheep, immediately after I was left with him.  The flock\n",
      "which I kept with the assistance of a boy, consisted of about forty.\n",
      "We drove them every morning between two and three miles to pasture,\n",
      "into the wide and delightful plains.  When night drew on, we drove\n",
      "them home and secured them in the cote.  In this round I continued\n",
      "during my stay there.  One incident that befel me when I was driving\n",
      "my flock from pasture, was so dreadful to me at that age, and is to\n",
      "this time fresh in my memory, that I cannot help noticing it in this\n",
      "place.  Two large dogs sallied out of a certain house and set upon me.\n",
      "One of them took me by the arm, and the other by the thigh, and before\n",
      "their master could come and relieve me, they lacerated my flesh to\n",
      "such a degree, that the scars are very visible to the present day.  My\n",
      "master was immediately sent for.  He came and carried me home, as I\n",
      "was unable to go myself on account of my wounds.  Nothing remarkable\n",
      "happened afterwards until my father sent for me to return home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before I dismiss this country, I must just inform my reader what I\n",
      "remember concerning this place.  A large river runs through this\n",
      "country in a westerly course.  The land for a great way on each side\n",
      "is flat and level, hedged in by a considerable rise of the country at\n",
      "a great distance from it.  It scarce ever rains there, yet the land is\n",
      "fertile; great dews fall in the night which refresh the soil.  About\n",
      "the latter end of June or first of July, the river begins to rise, and\n",
      "gradually increases until it has inundated the country for a great\n",
      "distance, to a height of seven or eight feet.  This brings on a slime\n",
      "which enriches the land surprisingly.  When the river has subsided,\n",
      "the natives begin to sow and plant, and the vegetation is exceedingly\n",
      "rapid.  Near this rich river my guardian's land lay.  He possessed, I\n",
      "cannot tell exactly how much, yet this I am certain of respecting it,\n",
      "that he owned an immense tract.  He possessed likewise a great many\n",
      "cattle and goats.  During my stay with him I was kindly used, and with\n",
      "as much tenderness, for what I saw, as his only son, although I was an\n",
      "entire stranger to him, remote from friends and relations.  The\n",
      "principal occupation of the inhabitants there, were the cultivation of\n",
      "the soil and the care of their flocks.  They were a people pretty\n",
      "similar in every respect to that of mine,  except in their persons,\n",
      "which were not so tall and stout.  They appeared to be very kind and\n",
      "friendly.  I will now return to my departure from that place.\n",
      "\n",
      "My father sent a man and horse after me.  After settling with my\n",
      "guardian for keeping me, he took me away and went for home.  It was\n",
      "then about one year since my mother brought me here.  Nothing\n",
      "remarkable occured to us on our journey until we arrived safe home.\n",
      "\n",
      "I found then that the difference between my parents had been made up\n",
      "previous to their sending for me.  On my return, I was received both\n",
      "by my father and mother with great joy and affection, and was once\n",
      "more restored to my paternal dwelling in peace and happiness.  I was\n",
      "then about six years old.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not more than six weeks had passed after my return, before a message\n",
      "was brought by an inhabitant of the place where I lived the preceding\n",
      "year to my father, that that place had been invaded by a numerous\n",
      "army, from a nation not far distant, furnished with musical\n",
      "instruments, and all kinds of arms then in use; that they were\n",
      "instigated by some white nation who equipped and sent them to subdue\n",
      "and possess the country, that his nation had made no preparation for\n",
      "war, having been for a long time in profound peace that they could not\n",
      "defend themselves against such a formidable train of invaders, and\n",
      "must therefore necessarily evacuate their lands to the fierce enemy,\n",
      "and fly to the protection of some chief; and that if he would permit\n",
      "them they should come under his rule and protection when they had to\n",
      "retreat from their own possessions.  He was a kind and merciful\n",
      "prince, and therefore consented to these proposals.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had scarcely returned to his nation with the message, before the\n",
      "whole of his people were obliged to retreat from their country, and\n",
      "come to my fathers dominions.\n",
      "\n",
      "He gave them every privilege and all the protection his government\n",
      "could afford.  But they had not been there longer than four days\n",
      "before news came to them that the invaders had laid waste their\n",
      "country, and were coming speedily to destroy them in my father's\n",
      "territories. This affrighted them, and therefore they immediately\n",
      "pushed off to the southward, into the unknown countries there, and\n",
      "were never more heard of.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two days after their retreat, the report turned out to be but too\n",
      "true.  A detachment of the enemy came to my father and informed him,\n",
      "that the whole army was encamped not far out of his dominions, and\n",
      "would invade the territory and deprive his people of their liberties\n",
      "and rights, if he did not comply with the following terms.  These were\n",
      "to pay them a large sum of money, three hundred fat cattle, and a\n",
      "great number of goats, sheep, asses, &c.\n",
      "\n",
      "My father told the messenger that he would comply rather than that his\n",
      "subjects should be deprived of their rights and privileges, which he\n",
      "was not then in circumstances to defend from so sudden an invasion.\n",
      "Upon turning out those articles, the enemy pledged their faith and\n",
      "honor that they would not attack him.  On these he relied and\n",
      "therefore thought it unnecessary to be on his guard against the enemy.\n",
      "But their pledges of faith and honor proved no better than those of\n",
      "other unprincipled hostile nations; for a few days after a certain\n",
      "relation of the king came and informed him, that the enemy who sent\n",
      "terms of accommodation to him, and received tribute to their\n",
      "satisfaction, yet meditated an attack on his subjects by surprise, and\n",
      "that probably they would commence their attack in less than one day,\n",
      "and concluded with advising him, as he was not prepared for war, to\n",
      "order a speedy retreat of his family and subjects.  He complied with\n",
      "this advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same night which was fixed upon to retreat, my father and his\n",
      "family set off about break of day.  The king and his two younger wives\n",
      "went in one company, and my mother and her children in another.  We\n",
      "left our dwellings in succession, and my father's company went on\n",
      "first.  We directed our course for a large shrub plain, some distance\n",
      "off, where we intended to conceal ourselves from the approaching\n",
      "enemy, until we could refresh and rest ourselves a little.  But we\n",
      "presently found that our retreat was not secure.  For having struck up\n",
      "a little fire for purposes of cooking victuals, the enemy who happened\n",
      "to be encamped a little distance off, had sent out a scouting party\n",
      "which discovered us by the smoke of the fire, just as we were\n",
      "extinguishing it and about to eat.  As soon as we had finished eating,\n",
      "my father discovered the party, and immediately began to discharge\n",
      "arrows at them.  This was what I first saw, and it alarmed both me and\n",
      "the women, who being unable to make any resistance, immediately betook\n",
      "ourselves to the tall thick reeds not far off, and left the old king\n",
      "to fight alone.  For some time, I beheld him from the reeds defending\n",
      "himself with  great courage and firmness, till at last he was obliged\n",
      "to surrender himself into their hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they came to us in the reeds, and the very first salute I had\n",
      "from them was a violent blow on the head with the fore part of a gun,\n",
      "and at the same time a grasp round the neck.  I then had a rope put\n",
      "about my neck, as had all the women in the thicket with me, and were\n",
      "immediately led to my father, who was likewise pinioned and haltered\n",
      "for leading.  In this condition we were all led to the camp.  The\n",
      "women and myself being pretty submissive, had tolerable treatment from\n",
      "the enemy, while my father was closely interrogated respecting his\n",
      "money which they knew he must have.  But as he gave them no account of\n",
      "it, he was instantly cut and pounded on his body with great\n",
      "inhumanity, that he might be induced by the torture he suffered to\n",
      "make the discovery.  All this availed not the least to make him give\n",
      "up his money, but he despised all the tortures which they inflicted,\n",
      "until the continued exercise and increase of torment, obliged him to\n",
      "sink and expire.  He thus died without informing his enemies of the\n",
      "place where his money lay.  I saw him while he was thus tortured to\n",
      "death.  The shocking scene is to this day fresh in my mind, and I have\n",
      "often been overcome while thinking on it.  He was a man of remarkable\n",
      "stature.  I should judge as much as six feet and six or seven inches\n",
      "high, two feet across his shoulders, and every way well proportioned.\n",
      "He as a man of remarkable strength and resolution, affable, kind and\n",
      "gentle, ruling with equity and moderation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The army of the enemy was large, I should suppose consisting of about\n",
      "six thousand men.  Their leader was called Baukurre.  After destroying\n",
      "the old prince, they decamped and immediately marched towards the sea,\n",
      "lying to the west, taking with them myself and the women prisoners.\n",
      "In the march a scouting party was detached from the main army.  To the\n",
      "leader of this party I was made waiter, having to carry his gun, &c.\n",
      "As we were a scouting we came across a herd of fat cattle, consisting\n",
      "of about thirty in number.  These we set upon, and immediately wrested\n",
      "from their keepers, and afterwards converted them into food for the\n",
      "army.  The enemy had remarkable success in destroying the country\n",
      "wherever they went.  For as far as they had penetrated, they laid the\n",
      "habitations waste and captured the people.  The distance they had now\n",
      "brought me was about four hundred miles.  All the march I had very\n",
      "hard tasks imposed on me, which I must perform on pain of punishment.\n",
      "I was obliged to carry on my head a large flat stone used for grinding\n",
      "our corn, weighing as I should suppose, as much as 25 pounds; besides\n",
      "victuals, mat and cooking utensils.  Though I was pretty large and\n",
      "stout of my age, yet these burthens were very grievous to me, being\n",
      "only about six years and a half old.\n",
      "\n",
      "We were then come to a place called Malagafco.  When we entered the\n",
      "place we could not see the least appearance of either houses or\n",
      "inhabitants, but upon stricter search found, that instead of houses\n",
      "above ground they had dens in the sides of hillocks, contiguous to\n",
      "ponds and streams of water.  In these we perceived they had all hid\n",
      "themselves, as I suppose they usually did upon such occasions.  In\n",
      "order to compel them to surrender, the enemy contrived to smoke them\n",
      "out with faggots.  These they put to the entrance of the caves and set\n",
      "them on fire.  While they were engaged in this business, to their\n",
      "great surprise some of them were desperately wounded with arrows which\n",
      "fell from above on them.  This mystery they soon found out.  They\n",
      "perceived that the enemy discharged these arrows through holes on the\n",
      "top of the dens directly in to the air.  Their weight brought them\n",
      "back, point downwards on their enemies heads, whilst they were smoking\n",
      "the inhabitants out.  The points of the arrows were poisoned, but\n",
      "their enemy had an antidote for it, which they instantly applied to\n",
      "the wounded part.  The smoke at last obliged the people to give\n",
      "themselves up.  They came out of their caves, first spatting the palms\n",
      "of their hands together, then and immediately after extended their\n",
      "arms, crossed at their wrists, ready to be bound and pinioned.  I\n",
      "should judge that the dens above mentioned were extended about eight\n",
      "feet horizontally into the earth, five feet in height and as many\n",
      "wide.  They were arched over head and lined with earth, which was of\n",
      "the clay kind, and made the surface of their walls firm and smooth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The invaders then pinioned the prisoners of all ages and sexes\n",
      "indiscriminately, took their flocks and all their effects, and moved\n",
      "on their way towards the sea.  On the march the prisoners were treated\n",
      "with clemency, on account of their being submissive and humble.\n",
      "Having come to the next tribe, the enemy laid siege and immediately\n",
      "took men, women, children, flocks, and all their valuable effects.\n",
      "They then went on to the next district which was contiguous with the\n",
      "sea, called in Africa, Anamaboo.  The enemies provisions were then\n",
      "almost spent, as well as their strength.  The inhabitants knowing what\n",
      "kind of conduct they had pursued, and what were their present\n",
      "intentions, improved the favorable opportunity, attacked them, and\n",
      "took enemy, prisoners, flocks and all their effects.  I was then taken\n",
      "a second time.  All of us were then put into the castle, and kept for\n",
      "market.  On a certain time I and other prisoners were put on board a\n",
      "canoe, under our master, and rowed away to a vessel belonging to Rhode\n",
      "Island, commanded by capt. Collingwood, and the mate Thomas Mumford.\n",
      "While we were going to the vessel, our master told us all to appear to\n",
      "the best possible advantage for sale.  I was bought on board by one\n",
      "Robertson Mumford, steward of said vessel, for four gallons of rum,\n",
      "and a piece of calico, and called VENTURE, on account of his having\n",
      "purchased me with his own private venture.  Thus I came by my name.\n",
      "All the slaves that were bought for that vessel's cargo, were two\n",
      "hundred and sixty.\n",

      "  _Containing an account of his life, from the time of his leaving\n",
      "               Africa, to that of his becoming free._\n",
      "\n",
      "After all the business was ended on the coast of Africa, the ship\n",
      "sailed from thence to Barbadoes.  After an ordinary passage, except\n",
      "great mortality from small pox, which broke out on board, we arrived\n",
      "at the island of Barbadoes: but when we reached it, there were found\n",
      "out of the two hundred and sixty that sailed from Africa, not more\n",
      "than two hundred alive.  These were all sold, except for myself and\n",
      "three more, to the planters there.\n",
      "\n",
      "The vessel then sailed for Rhode Island, and arrived there after a\n",
      "comfortable passage.  Here my master sent me to live with one of his\n",
      "sisters, until he could carry me to Fisher's Island, the place of his\n",
      "residence.  I had then competed my eighth year.  After staying with\n",
      "his sister some time I was taken to my master's place to live.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we arrived at Narragansett, my master went ashore in order to\n",
      "return a part of the way by land, and gave me the charge of the keys\n",
      "of his trunks on board the vessel, and charged me not to deliver them\n",
      "up to any body, not even to his father without his orders.  To his\n",
      "directions I promised faithfully to conform.  When I arrived with my\n",
      "master's articles at his house, my master's father asked me for his\n",
      "son's keys, as he wanted to see what his trunks contained.  I told him\n",
      "that my master intrusted me with the care of them until he should\n",
      "return, and that I had given him my word to be faithful to the trust,\n",
      "and could not therefore give him or any other person the keys without\n",
      "my master's directions.  He insisted that I should deliver him the\n",
      "keys, threatening to punish me if I did not.  But I let him know that\n",
      "he should not have them say what he would.  He then laid aside trying\n",
      "to get them.  But notwithstanding he appeared to give up trying to\n",
      "obtain them from me, yet I mistrusted that he would take some time\n",
      "when I was off my guard, either in the day time or at night to get\n",
      "them, therefore I slung them around my neck, and in the day concealed\n",
      "them in my bosom, and at night I always lay with them under me, that\n",
      "no person might take them from me without being apprized of it.  Thus\n",
      "I kept the keys from every body until my master came home.  When he\n",
      "returned he asked where VENTURE was.  As I was then within hearing, I\n",
      "came, said, here sir, at your service.  He asked me for his keys, and\n",
      "I immediately took them off my neck and reached them out to him.  He\n",
      "took them, stroked my hair, and commended me, saying in presence of\n",
      "his father that his young VENTURE was so faithful that he would never\n",
      "have been able to have taken the keys from him but by violence; that\n",
      "he should not fear to trust him with his whole fortune, for that he\n",
      "had been in his native place so habituated to keeping his word, that\n",
      "he would sacrifice even his life to maintain it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first of the time of living at my master's own place, I was pretty\n",
      "much employed in the house at carding wool and other household\n",
      "business.  In this situation I continued for some years, after which\n",
      "my master put me to work out of doors.  After many proofs of my\n",
      "faithfulness and honesty, my master began to put great confidence in\n",
      "me.  My behavior to him had as yet been submissive and obedient.  I\n",
      "then began to have hard tasks imposed on me.  Some of these were to\n",
      "pound four bushels of ears of corn every night in a barrel for the\n",
      "poultry, or be rigorously punished.  At other seasons of the year I\n",
      "had to card wool until a very late hour.  These tasks I had to perform\n",
      "when I was about nine years old.  Some time after I had another\n",
      "difficulty and oppression which was greater than any I had ever\n",
      "experienced since I came into this country.  This was to serve two\n",
      "masters.  James Mumford, my master's son, when his father had gone\n",
      "from home in the morning, and given me a stint to perform that day,\n",
      "would order me to do _this_ and _that_ business different from what my\n",
      "master directed me.  One day in particular, the authority which my\n",
      "master's son had set up, had like to have produce melancholy effects.\n",
      "For my master having set me off my business to perform that day and\n",
      "then left me to perform it, his son came up to me in the course of the\n",
      "day, big with authority, and and commanded me very arrogantly to quit\n",
      "my present business and go directly about what he should order me.  I\n",
      "replied to him that my master had given me so much to perform that\n",
      "day, and that I must therefore faithfully complete it in that time.\n",
      "He then broke out in a great rage, snatched a pitchfork and went to\n",
      "lay me over the head therewith; but I as soon got another and defended\n",
      "myself with it, or otherwise he might have murdered me in his outrage.\n",
      "He immediately called some people who were hearing at work for him,\n",
      "and ordered them to take his hair rope and and come and bind me with\n",
      "it.  They all tried to bind me but in vain, tho' there were three\n",
      "assistants in number.  My upstart master than desisted, put his pocket\n",

      "mother of the struggle with young VENTURE.  He told her that their\n",
      "young VENTURE had become so stubborn that he could not controul him,\n",
      "and asked her what he should do with him.  In the mean time I\n",
      "recovered my temper, voluntarily caused myself to be bound by the same\n",
      "men who tried in vain before, and carried before my young master, that\n",
      "he might do what he pleased with me.  He took me to a gallows made for\n",
      "the purpose of hanging cattle on, and suspended me on it.  Afterwards\n",
      "he ordered one of his hands to go to the peach orchard and cut him\n",
      "three dozens of whips to punish me with.  These were brought to him,\n",
      "and that was all that was done with them, as I was released and went\n",

      "After I lived with my master thirteen years, being then about twenty\n",
      "two years old, I married Meg, a slave of his who was about my age.  My\n",
      "master owned a certain Irishman, named Heddy, who about that time\n",
      "formed a plan of secretly leaving his master.  After he had long had\n",
      "this plan in meditation he suggested it to me.  At first I cast a deaf\n",
      "ear on it, and rebuked Heddy for harboring in his mind such a rash\n",
      "undertaking.  But after he had persuaded and much enchanted me with\n",
      "the prospect of gaining my freedom with such a method, I at length\n",
      "agreed to accompany him.  Heddy next inveigled two of his fellow\n",
      "servants to accompany us.  The place to which we designed to go was\n",
      "the Mississippi.  Our next business was to lay in a sufficient store\n",
      "of provisions for our voyage.  We privately collected out of our\n",
      "master's store, six great old cheeses, two firkins of butter, and one\n",
      "whole batch of new bread.  When we had gathered all our own clothes\n",
      "and some more, we took them all about midnight, and went to the water\n",
      "side.  We stole our master's boat, embarked, then directed our course\n",
      "for the Mississippi river.\n",
      "\n",
      "We mutually confederated not to betray or desert one another on pain\n",
      "of death.  We first steered our course for Montauk point, the east end\n",
      "of Long-Island.  After our arrival there we landed, and Heddy and I\n",
      "made an incursion into the island after fresh water, while our two\n",
      "comrades were left at a little distance from the boat, employed at\n",
      "cooking.  When Heddy and I had sought some time for water, he returned\n",
      "to our companions, and I continued on looking for my object.  When\n",
      "Heddy had performed his business with our companions, who were engaged\n",
      "in cooking, he went directly to the boat, stole all the clothes in it,\n",
      "and then travelled away for East-Hampton, as I was informed.  I\n",
      "returned to my fellows not long after.  They informed me that our\n",
      "clothes were stolen, but could not determine who was the thief, yet\n",
      "they suspected Heddy as he was missing.  After reproving my two\n",
      "comrades for not taking care of our things which were in the boat, I\n",
      "advertised Heddy and sent two men in search of him.  They pursued and\n",
      "overtook him at Southampton and returned him to the boat.  I then\n",
      "thought it might afford some chance for my freedom, or at least a\n",
      "palliation for my running away, to return Heddy immediately to his\n",
      "master, and inform him that I was induced to go away by Heddy's\n",
      "address.  Accordingly I set off with him and the rest of my companions\n",
      "for our master's, and arrived there without any difficulty.  I\n",
      "informed my master that Heddy was the ringleader of our revolt, and\n",
      "that he had used us ill.  He immediately put Heddy into custody, and\n",
      "myself and companions were well received and went to work as usual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a long time passed after that, before Heddy was sent by my master\n",
      "to New-London gaol.  At the close of that year I was sold to a Thomas\n",
      "Stanton, and had to be separated from my wife and one daughter, who\n",
      "was about one month old.  He resided at Stonington-point.  To this\n",
      "place I brought with me from my last master's, two johannes, three old\n",
      "Spanish dollars, and two thousand of coppers, besides five pounds of\n",
      "my wife's money.  This money I got by cleaning gentlemen's shoes and\n",
      "drawing boots, by catching musk-rats and minks, raising potatoes and\n",
      "carrots, &c. and by fishing in the night, and at odd spells.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this money amounting to near twenty-one pounds York currency, my\n",
      "master's brother, Robert Stanton, hired of me, for which he gave me\n",
      "his note.  About one year and a half after that time, my master\n",
      "purchased my wife and and her child, for severn hundred pounds old\n",
      "tenor.  One time my master sent me two miles after a barrel of\n",
      "molasses, and ordered me to carry it on my shoulders.  I made out to\n",
      "carry it all the way to my master's house.  When I lived with Captain\n",
      "George Mumford, only to try my strength, I took up on my knees a\n",
      "tierce of salt containing seven bushels, and carried it two or three\n",
      "rods.  Of this fact there are several eye witnesses now living.\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards the close of the time that I resided with this master, I had a\n",
      "falling out with my mistress.  This happened one time when my master\n",
      "was gone to Long-Island a gunning.  At first the quarrel began between\n",
      "my wife and her mistress.  I was then at work in the barn, and hearing\n",
      "a racket in the house, induced me to run there and see what had broken\n",
      "out.  When I entered the house, I found my mistress in a violent\n",
      "passion with my wife, for what she informed me was a mere trifle; such\n",
      "a small affair that I forbear to put my mistress to the shame of\n",
      "having it known.  I earnestly requested my wife to beg pardon of her\n",
      "mistress for the sake of peace even if she had given no just occasion\n",
      "for offence.  But whilst I was thus saying my mistress turned the\n",
      "blows which she was repeating on my wife to me.  She took down her\n",
      "horse-whip, and while she was glutting her fury with it, I reached out\n",
      "my great black hand, raised it up and received the blows of the whip\n",
      "on it which were designed for my head.  Then I immediately committed\n",
      "the whip to the devouring fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "When my master returned from the island, his wife told him of the\n",
      "affair, but for the present he seemed to take no notice of it, and\n",
      "mentioned not a word of it to me.  Some days after his return, in the\n",
      "morning as I was putting on a log in the fire-place, not suspecting\n",
      "harm from any one, I received a most violent stroke on the crown of my\n",
      "head with a club two feet long and and as large around as a chair-\n",
      "post.  This blow very badly wounded my head, and the scar of it\n",
      "remains to this day.  The first blow made me have my wits about me as\n",
      "you may suppose, for as soon as he went to renew it, I snatched the\n",
      "club out of his hands and dragged him out of the door.  He then sent\n",
      "for his brother to come and assist him, but I presently left my\n",
      "master, took the club he wounded me with, carried it to a neighboring\n",
      "Justice of the Peace, and complained of my master.  He finally advised\n",
      "me to return to my master, and live contented with him until he abused\n",
      "me again, and then complain.  I consented to do accordingly.  But\n",
      "before I set out for my master's, up he come and his brother Robert\n",
      "after me.  The Justice improved this convenient opportunity to caution\n",
      "my master.  He asked him for what he treated his slave thus hastily\n",
      "and unjustly, and told him what would be the consequence if he\n",
      "continued the same treatment towards me.  After the Justice had ended\n",
      "his discourse with my master, he and his brother set out with me for\n",
      "home, one before and the other behind me.  When they had come to a bye\n",
      "place, they both dismounted their respective horses, and fell to\n",
      "beating me with great violence.  I became enraged at this and\n",
      "immediately turned them both under me, laid one of them across the\n",
      "other, and stamped both with my feet what I would.\n",
      "\n",
      "This occasioned my master's brother to advise him to put me off.  A\n",
      "short time after this I was taken by a constable and two men.  They\n",
      "carried me to a black-smith's shop and had me hand-cuffed.  When I\n",
      "returned home my mistress enquired much of her waiters, whether\n",
      "VENTURE was hand-cuffed.  When she was informed that I was, she\n",
      "appeared to be very contented and was much transported with the news.\n",
      "In the midst of all this content and joy, I presented myself before my\n",
      "mistress, shewed her my hand-cuffs, and gave her thanks for my gold\n",
      "rings.  For this my master commanded a negro of his to fetch him a\n",
      "large ox chain.  This my master locked on my legs with two padlocks.\n",
      "I continued to wear the chain peaceably for two or three days, when my\n",
      "master asked me with contemptuous hard names whether I had not better\n",
      "be freed from my chains and go to work.  I answered him, No.  Well\n",
      "then, said he, I will send you to the West-Indies or banish you, for I\n",
      "am resolved not to keep you.  I answered him I crossed the waters to\n",
      "come here, and I am willing to cross them to return.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a day or two after this not any one said much to me, until one\n",
      "Hempsted Miner, of Stonington, asked me if I would live with him.  I\n",
      "answered him that I would.  He then requested me to make myself\n",
      "discontented and to appear as unreconciled to my master as I could\n",
      "before that he bargained with him for me; and that in return he would\n",
      "give me a good chance to gain my freedom when I came to live with him.\n",
      "I did as he requested me.  Not long after Hempsted Miner purchased me\n",
      "of my master for fifty-six pounds lawful.  He took the chain and\n",
      "padlocks off me immediately after.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may here be remembered, that I related a few pages back, that I\n",
      "hired out a sum of money to Mr. Robert Stanton, and took his note for\n",
      "it.  In the fray between my master Stanton and myself, he broke open\n",
      "my chest containing his brother's note to me, and destroyed it.\n",
      "Immediately after my present master bought me, he determined to sell\n",
      "me at Hartford.  As soon as I became apprized of it, I bethought\n",
      "myself that I would secure a certain sum of money which lay by me,\n",
      "safer than to hire it out to Stanton.  Accordingly I buried it in the\n",
      "earth, a little distance from Thomas Stanton's, in the road over which\n",
      "he passed daily.  A short time after my master carried me to Hartford,\n",
      "and first proposed to sell me to one William Hooker of that place.\n",
      "Hooker asked whether I would go to the German Flats with him.  I\n",
      "answered, No.  He said I should, if not by fair means I should by\n",
      "foul.  If you will go by no other measures, I will tie you down in my\n",
      "sleigh.  I replied to him, that if he carried me in that manner, no\n",
      "person would purchase me, for it would be thought that he had a\n",
      "murderer for sale.  After this he tried no more, and said he would not\n",
      "have me as a gift.\n",
      "\n",
      "My master next offered me to Daniel Edwards, Esq. of Hartford, for\n",
      "sale.  But not purchasing me, my master pawned me to him for ten\n",
      "pounds, and returned to Stonington.  After some trial of my honesty,\n",
      "Mr. Edwards placed considerable trust and confidence in me.  He put me\n",
      "to serve as his cup-bearer and waiter.  When there was company at his\n",
      "house, he would send me into his cellar and other parts of his house\n",
      "to fetch wine and other articles occasionally for them.  When I had\n",
      "been with him for some time, he asked me why my master wished to part\n",
      "with such an honest negro, and why he did not keep me himself.  I\n",
      "replied that I could not give him the reason, unless it was to convert\n",
      "me into cash, and speculate with me as with other commodities.  I hope\n",
      "he can never justly say it was on account of my ill conduct that he\n",
      "did no keep me himself.  Mr Edwards told me that he should be very\n",
      "willing to keep me himself, and that he would never let me go from him\n",
      "to live, if it was not unreasonable and inconvenient for me to be\n",
      "parted from my wife and children; therefore he would furnish me with a\n",
      "horse to return to Stonington, if I had a mind for it.  As Miner did\n",
      "not appear to redeem me I went, at called at my old master Stanton's\n",
      "first to see my wife, who was then owned by him. As my old master\n",
      "appeared much ruffled at my being there, I left my wife before I had\n",
      "spent considerable time with her, and went to Colonel O. Smith's.\n",
      "Miner had not as yet wholly settled with Stanton for me, and had\n",
      "before my return from Hartford given Col. Smith a bill of sale for me.\n",
      "These men once met to determine which of them should hold me, and upon\n",
      "my expressing a desire to be owned by Col. Smith, and upon my master's\n",
      "settling the remainder of the money which was due Stanton for me, it\n",
      "was agreed that I should live with Col. Smith.  This was the third\n",
      "time of my being sold, and I was then thirty-one years old.  As I\n",
      "never had an opportunity of redeeming myself whilst I was owned by\n",
      "Miner, though he promised to give me a chance, I was then very\n",
      "ambitious of obtaining it.  I asked my master one time if he would\n",
      "consent to have me purchase my freedom.  He replied that he would.  I\n",
      "was then very happy, knowing that I was at that time able to pay part\n",
      "of the purchase money, by means of the money which I some time since\n",
      "buried.  This I took out of the earth and tendered to my master,\n",
      "having previously engaged a free negro man to take take his security\n",
      "for it, as I was the property of my master, and therefore could not\n",
      "safely take his obligation myself.  What was wanted in redeeming\n",
      "myself, my master agreed to wait on me for, until I could procure it\n",
      "for him.  I still continued to work for Col. Smith.  Ther was\n",
      "continually some interest accruing on my master's note to my friend\n",
      "the free negro man above named, which I received, and with some\n",
      "besides which I got by fishing, I laid out in land adjoining my old\n",
      "master Stanton's.  By cultivating this land with the greatest\n",
      "diligence and economy, at times when my master did not require my\n",
      "labor, in two years I laid up ten pounds.  This my friend tendered to\n",
      "my master for myself, and received his note for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being encouraged by the success which I had met in redeeming myself, I\n",
      "again solicited my master for a further chance of completing it.  The\n",
      "chance for which I solicited him was that of going out to work the\n",
      "ensuing winter.  He agreed to this on condition that I would give him\n",
      "one quarter of my earnings.  On these terms I worked the following\n",
      "winter, and earned four pounds sixteen shillings, one quarter of which\n",
      "went to my master for the privilege, and the rest was paid him on my\n",
      "own account.  This added to the other payments made up forty four\n",
      "pounds, eight shillings, which I had paid on my own account.  I was\n",
      "then about thirty five years old.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next summer I again desired he would give me a chance of going out\n",
      "to work.  But he refused and answered that he must have my labor this\n",
      "summer, as he did not have it the past winter.  I replied that I\n",
      "considered it as hard that I could not have a chance to work out when\n",
      "the season became advantageous, and that I must only be permitted to\n",
      "hire myself out in the poorest season of the year.  He asked me after\n",
      "this what I would give for the privilege per month.  I replied that I\n",
      "would leave it wholly with his own generosity to determine what I\n",
      "should return him a month.  Well then, said he, if so two pounds a\n",
      "month.  I answered him that if that was the least he would take I\n",
      "would be contented.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, I hired myself out at Fisher's Island, and earned twenty\n",
      "pounds; thirteen pounds six shillings of which my master drew for the\n",
      "privilege, and the remainder I paid him for my freedom.  This made\n",
      "fifty-one pounds two shillings which I paid him.  In October following\n",
      "I went and wrought six months at Long Island.  In that six months'\n",
      "time I cut and corded four hundred cords of wood, besides threshing\n",
      "out seventy-five bushels of grain, and received of my wages down only\n",
      "twenty pounds, which left remaining a larger sum.  Whilst I was out\n",
      "that time, I took upon my wages only one pair of shoes.  At night I\n",
      "lay upon the hearth, with one coverlet over and another under me.  I\n",
      "returned to my master and gave him what I received on my six months\n",
      "labor.  This left only thirteen pounds eighteen shillings to make up\n",
      "the full sum for my redemption.  My master liberated me, saying I\n",
      "might pay what was behind if I could ever make it convenient,\n",
      "otherwise it would be well.  The amount of the money which I had paid\n",
      "my master towards redeeming my time, was seventy-one pounds two\n",
      "shillings.  The reason of my master for asking such an unreasonable\n",
      "price, was he said, to secure himself in case I should ever come to\n",
      "want.  Being thirty-six years old, I left Col. Smith once for all.  I\n",
      "had already been sold three different times, made considerable money\n",
      "with seemingly nothing to derive it from, been cheated out of a large\n",
      "sum of money, lost much by misfortunes, and paid an enormous sum for\n",

      "My wife and children were yet in bondage to Mr. Thomas Stanton.  About\n",
      "this time I lost a chest, containing besides clothing, about thirty-\n",
      "eight pounds in paper money.  It was burnt by accident.  A short time\n",
      "after I sold all my possessions at Stonington, consisting of a pretty\n",
      "piece of land and one dwelling house thereon, and went to reside at\n",
      "Long-Island.  For the first four years of my residence there, I spent\n",
      "my time in working for various people on that and at the neighboring\n",
      "islands.  I the space of six months I cut and corded upwards of four\n",
      "hundred cords of wood.  Many other singular and wonderful labors I\n",
      "performed in cutting wood there, which would not be inferior to those\n",
      "just recited, but for brevity sake I must omit them.  In the\n",
      "aforementioned four years what wood I cut at Long-Island amounted to\n",
      "several thousand cords, and the money which I earned thereby amounted\n",
      "to two hundred and seven pounds ten shillings.  This money I laid up\n",
      "carefully by me.  Perhaps some may enquire what maintained me all the\n",
      "time I was laying up money.  I would inform them that I bought nothing\n",
      "which I did not absolutely want.  All fine clothes I despised in\n",

      "comfortable for common days, and perhaps I would have a garment or two\n",
      "which I did not have on at all times, but as for superfluous finery I\n",
      "never thought it to be compared with a decent homespun dress, a good\n",
      "supply of money and prudence.  Expensive gatherings of my mates I\n",
      "commonly shunned, and all kinds of luxuries I was perfectly a stranger\n",
      "to; and during the time I was employed in cutting the aforementioned\n",
      "quantity of wood, I never was at the expense of six-pence worth of\n",
      "spirits.  Being after this labor forty years of age, I worked at\n",
      "various places, and in particular on Ram-Island, which I purchased\n",

      "\n",
      "It will here be remembered how much money I earned by cutting wood in\n",
      "four years.  Besides this I had considerable money, amounting in all\n",

      "no other reason than to oblige him, and gave him sixty pounds.  But in\n",

      "farm which I owned before, and a dwelling house thereon.  Forty four\n",
      "years had then completed their revolution since my entrance in to this\n",
      "existence of servitude and misfortune.  Solomon my eldest son, being\n",
      "then in his seventeenth year, and all my hope and dependence for help,\n",
      "I hired him out to one Charles Church, of Rhode Island, for one year,\n",

      "dollars with her in better than one year.  I had then become something\n",
      "forehanded, and being in my forty-fourth year, I purchased my wife\n",

      "melons I sold there, amounted to nearly five hundred dollars.  Various\n",

      "shortly after went a whaling voyage in the service of Col. Smith.\n",
      "After being seven months, the vessel returned, laden with four hundred\n",
      "barrels of oil.  About this time, I became possessed of another\n",
      "dwelling-house, and my temporal affairs were in a pretty prosperous\n",
      "condition.  This and my industry was what alone saved me from being\n",
      "expelled that part of the island in which I resided, as an act was\n",
      "passed by the select-men of the place, that all negroes residing there\n",
      "should be expelled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next after my wife, I purchased a negro man for four hundred dollars.\n",
      "But he having an inclination to return to his old master, I therefore\n",
      "let him go.  Shortly after I purchased another negro man for twenty-\n",
      "five pounds, who I parted with shortly after.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being about forty-six years old, I bought my oldest child Hannah, of\n",

      "About the forty-seventh year of my life, I disposed all my property at\n",
      "Long-Island, and came from thence into East-Haddam.  I hired myself\n",
      "out at first to Timothy Chapman, for five weeks, the earnings of which\n",
      "time I put carefully by me.  After this I wrought for Abel Bingham\n",
      "about six weeks.  I then put my money together and purchased of said\n",
      "Bingham ten acres of land, lying at Haddam neck, where I now reside.\n",
      "On this land I labored with great diligence for two years, and shortly\n",
      "after purchased six acres more of land contiguous to my other.  One\n",
      "year from that time I purchased seventy acres more of the same man,\n",
      "and paid for it mostly with the produce of my other land.  Soon after\n",
      "I bought this lot of land, I set up a comfortable dwelling house on my\n",
      "farm, and built it from the produce thereof.  Shortly after I had much\n",
      "trouble and expense with my daughter Hannah, whose name has before\n",
      "been mentioned in this account.  She was married soon after I redeemed\n",
      "her, to one Isaac, a free negro, and shortly after her marriage fell\n",
      "sick of a mortal disease; her husband a dissolute and abandoned\n",
      "wretch, paid but little attention to her in her illness.  I therefore\n",
      "thought it best to bring her to my house and nurse her there.  I\n",
      "procured her all the aid mortals could afford, but notwithstanding\n",
      "this she fell a prey to her disease, after a lingering and painful\n",
      "endurance of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The physician's bills for attending her during her illness amounted to\n",
      "forty pounds.  Having reached my fifty-fourth year, I hired two negro\n",
      "men, one named William Jacklin, and the other Mingo.  Mingo lived with\n",
      "me one year, and having received his wages, run in debt to me eight\n",
      "dollars, for which he gave me his note.  I procured a warrant, took\n",
      "him, and requested him to go to Justice Throop's of his own accord,\n",
      "but he refusing, I took him on my shoulders, and carried him there,\n",
      "distant about two miles.  The justice asking me if I had my prisoner's\n",
      "note with me, and replying that I had not, he told me that I must\n",
      "return with him and get it.  Accordingly I carried Mingo back on my\n",
      "shoulders, but before we arrived at my dwelling, he complained of\n",
      "being hurt, and asked me if this was not a hard way of treating our\n",
      "fellow creatures.  I answered him that it would be hard thus to treat\n",
      "our honest fellow creatures.  He then told me that if I would let him\n",
      "off my shoulders, he had a pair of silver shoe-buckles, one shirt and\n",
      "a pocket handkerchief, which he would turn out to me.  I agreed, and\n",
      "let him return home with me on foot; but the very following night, he\n",
      "slipped from me, stole my horse and has never paid me even his note.\n",
      "The other negro man, Jacklin, being a comb-maker by trade, he\n",
      "requested me to set him up, and promised to reward me well with his\n",
      "labor.  Accordingly I bought him a set of tools for making combs, and\n",
      "procured him stock.  He worked at my house about one year, and then\n",
      "run away from me with all his combs, and owed me for all his board.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since my residence at Haddam neck, I have owned of boats, canoes and\n",
      "sail vessels, not less than twenty.  These I mostly employed in the\n",
      "fishing and trafficking business, and in these occupations I have been\n",
      "cheated out of considerable money by people whom I traded with taking\n",
      "advantage of my ignorance of numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "About twelve years ago, I hired a whale-boat and four black men, and\n",
      "proceeded to Long-Island after a load of round clams.  Having arrived\n",
      "there, I first purchased of James Webb, son of Orange Webb, six\n",
      "hundred and sixty clams, and afterwards, with the help of my men,\n",
      "finished loading my boat.  The same evening, however, this Webb stole\n",
      "my boat, and went in her to Connecticut river, and sold her cargo for\n",
      "his own benefit.  I thereupon pursued him, and at length, after an\n",
      "additional expence of nine crowns, recovered the boat; but for the\n",
      "proceeds of her cargo I never could obtain any compensation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four years after, I met with another loss, far superior to this in\n",
      "value, and I think by no less wicked means.  Being going to New-London\n",
      "with a grand-child, I took passage on an Indian's boat, and went there\n",
      "with him.  On our return, the Indian took on board two hogsheads of\n",
      "molasses, one of which belonged to Capt. Elisha Hart, of Saybrook, to\n",
      "be delivered to his wharf.  When we arrived there, and while I was\n",
      "gone, at the request of the Indian, to inform Captain Hart of his\n",
      "arrival, and receive the freight for him, one hogshead of the molasses\n",
      "had been lost overboard by the people in attempting to land it on the\n",
      "wharf.  Although I was absent at the time, and had no concern whatever\n",
      "in the business, and was known to a number of respectable witnesses, I\n",
      "was nevertheless persecuted by this conscientious gentleman, (the\n",
      "Indian not being able to pay for it) and obliged to pay upwards of ten\n",
      "pounds lawful money, with all the costs of court.  I applied to\n",
      "several gentlemen for counsel in this affair, and they advised me, as\n",
      "my adversary was rich, and threatened to carry the matter from court\n",
      "to court till it would cost me more than the first damages would be,\n",
      "to pay the sum and submit to the injury; which I accordingly did, and\n",
      "he has often since insultingly taunted me with my unmerited\n",
      "misfortune.  Such a proceeding as this, committed on a defenseless\n",
      "stranger, almost worn out in the hard service of the world, without\n",
      "any foundation in reason or justice, whatever it may be called in a\n",
      "christian land, would in my native country be branded a crime equal to\n",
      "highway robbery.  But Captain Hart was a _white gentleman_, and I a\n",
      "_poor African,_ and therefore it was _all right, and good enough for\n",
      "the black dog._\n",
      "\n",
      "I am now sixty nine years old.  Though once straight and tall,\n",
      "measuring without shoes six feet one inch and an half, and every way\n",
      "well proportioned, I am now bowed down with age and hardship.  My\n",
      "strength which was once equal if not superior to any man whom I have\n",
      "ever seen, is now enfeebled so that life is a burden, and it is with\n",
      "fatigue that I can walk a couple of miles, stooping over my staff.\n",
      "Other griefs are still behind; on account of which some aged people,\n",
      "at least, will pity me.  My eye-sight has gradually failed, till I am\n",
      "almost blind, and whenever I go abroad one of my grand-children must\n",

      "freedom is a privilege which nothing else can equal.  Notwithstanding\n",

      "the cruelty and oppression of false-hearted friends, and the perfidy\n",
      "of my own countrymen whom I have assisted and redeemed from bondage, I\n",
      "am no possessed of more than two hundred acres of land, and three\n",
